I swear burrata didn't exist five years ago
I don't know exactly know why my brain can't figure it out; it might be that the tools are just so broad and vague that my brain just hardlocks due to 'too many options'.
Because for Interspeech, we could also like split it paper by paper. So that some papers would go to the Interspeech proceedings. And some of our submission papers would come later for the PBML proceedings. And the authors would be free to choose. So that we have to negotiate this with either SIGDial or Interspeech. If it is okay for them to have some of our papers, given that these papers are submitted by the March deadline. So, there is an absolute strict requirement. And I think it's they cannot have anything against it. Because if the paper is worth publishing. Like, it's only a bonus that the paper has some shared task result appearing in the satellite event. So yeah, I think it's okay. So, we do not need to ask for a special session. In Interspeech it is called special session, we don't want that. In Interspeech we want the satellite event. But we will tell our people. If you manage to have your paper ready by the Interspeech deadline, send it as an Interspeech paper and you will have it within Interspeech. Ah, if you do not, ah, do it for the Interspeech deadline, here is our deadline. And that is for PBML.
My neighbor & I arrived home at the same time and I could hear him coughing up a covid mucus storm from across the street. So I rushed to get into my apt to avoid him but he still managed to catch up to me to chat. I swear covid-infected people are zombies trying to infect everyone else.
(PERSON1) Yeah, so, I mean, right now, I was doing the same.
This would be mainly for web browsing, occasional email, and some games.
(PERSON10) Okay, so one question just for me just to make sure in the concatenation settings you insert the sentence separator token, right? You have a special token to distinguish like which is the source and which is the context or the other sentence or do you just concatenate them without anything? And hope that the system learns it?
Donald Trump's heavily mortgaged skyscraper at 40 Wall Street is on "lender watch" amid plummeting income and increasing costs, Bloomberg reported Friday. The vacancy rate at the 72-story building - Trump's most valuable - jumped to almost 18% in the third quarter of last year, according to a monthly filing on the building's remaining $126.5 million mortgage, Bloomberg reported. Expenses, meanwhile, have reportedly risen 11% since the origin of the 2015 mortgage. Trump has often bragged about the building he acquired in 1995, which was appraised at $540 million in 2015.
Loved the ring - but couldn't wear it all the time! :( This ring was beautiful. I loved the design and the chunky feel of it; it looked expensive and it was very comfortable! The only reason why I gave only 3 stars and ultimately returned the product is because I realized I wouldn't be able to wear it all the time. I like to wear my rings all the time, which is why I always make sure to get sterling silver, and I know some people said that their rings tarnished after a while, but I had worn mine for about a week straight - even while washing my hands - and noticed no tarnishing. Interestingly enough, the issue I had was that the inner band of the ring was actually turning my finger white and moist - kind of like the way a bandaid does after you leave it on for a long time. This happened even when I made sure the ring and my finger was completely dry. I don't know why this happened and have never had it happen with any other ring, but it became uncomfortable so I decided it wasn't the ring for me. :( Too bad because I really did love it! So if you are purchasing this ring with the intent to wear it only occasionally, I say go for it!! You won't be disappointed!
(PERSON3) Oh yeah, just I do not know if you if you, if you catch <unintelligible/> when we were talking about [PERSON1], but one thing, is, that, that the (blow) is better but the other thing is that the lemmas are actually properly inflected manually, but that is that is another, no, no problem, it is actually good that is <unintelligible/> right, yeah. So, I was thinking there might be. But I'm not sure whether we have some test data for that, but we might try to play around with the models with some sort of style transfer? As you know, we can use a constraint and try to use a synonymous constraint instead and see or compare how, how, what is the difference between the outputs. But this is, like I'm just describing it vaguely because I myself do not have an exact idea how to do it, but it might have been an interesting, distinct scenario. I do not know, [PERSON1], do you know about any style transfer data for English Czech? Do we have something?
I haven't really achieved anything. I'm happy that a few people have come to me in private and said "look, because of all your work, I'm gonna grant you this amount of money".
At the other end of the spectrum, just 184 foreign residents called Marka home, and just over 700 lived in the city's central borough. Ullern, Vestre Aker and Nordstrand made up the other boroughs with the fewest foreign residents. However, these boroughs had significantly more immigrants living there than in central Oslo and Marka. Those from EU and EEA countries and those from the United Kingdom mostly lived in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo and St. Hanshaugen. Meanwhile, while plenty of citizens from Asia, including Turkey, also resided in Game Oslo (5,837), the majority were registered as living in the boroughs of Alna, Stovner and Søndre Nordstrand.
The day of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center and killed 3,000 people, a Trump bragged in a TV interview that 40 Wall Street was suddenly the tallest building in the city. Not only was his claim insensitive, it was also a lie.
The disgraced former MP Jared O'Mara "should never have been selected as a Labour candidate" and deserves his four-year jail sentence, the shadow chancellor has said. Rachel Reeves was talking to the Guardian in the Bolton North East constituency on Friday, hours after key figures in the local party quit in protest at how Labour's national executive committee (NEC) was controlling the parliamentary selection process for the next general election.
This is a very brief sketch of a plausible argument that theories of capitalism influencing the actual content of science are consistent with theories asserting the existence of objective scientific facts. It's *not* an argument in favor of the existence of objective scientific facts, which I don't believe in.

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources came to the rescue of a bear-y unlucky bear after it became trapped in a ditch. The bear had hunkered down in a culvert alongside the road near Wannaska, Minnesota, according to a Facebook post from the department. But when the snow began to melt, the culvert started to flood, trapping the bear in deep snow and ice, according to the department. Staff from the department quickly responded to the scene and helped remove the bear. The department's bear biologist, Andrew Tri, "examined the bear and pronounced him healthy but groggy - obviously, because he'd been woken up from his winter sleep," according to the Facebook post. The department then relocated the bear to a state sanctuary to resume his hibernation. The sleepy carnivore was estimated to be 6 years old and between 375 and 400 pounds.

Modrow, a reform-minded communist, took over East Germany shortly after the Berlin Wall fell and later invited opposition forces into the government, but could not slow the gathering momentum for German reunification. "The entire peaceful course of establishing German unity was precisely a special achievement of his," the Left wrote on Twitter."That will remain his political legacy." During 16 years as communist party chief in Dresden, starting in 1973, Modrow built a reputation as an anti-establishment figure. He rejected party perks and insisted on living in a normal apartment.

(PERSON8) I don't remember, so I don't remember exactly but this is like what- when I started in summer with those multi-source experiments. The first thing I started with was concatenating the paraphrase and source and maybe I, I don't remember now, I can check it till the next meeting whether I tried also, I definitely tried when the sources are on the first position then some delimiter and the paraphrase on the second position. I might have also tried that I shuffled the two things randomly, yeah, and I just remember that it did abundantly this compenetration stuff and tried multi-encoders.

A pedestrian has died following a collision with a car in Fife. The 38-year-old female was rushed to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy following the crash on Broad Street in Cowdenbeath on Friday around 1.30pm. A 24-year-old man has subsequently been arrested in connection with the crash. Police are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with dash-cam footage to come forward. Sergeant Lee Walkingshaw said: "Our enquiries are ongoing and we are appealing for anyone who was in the area and who witnessed the crash to get in touch." I would also appeal to anyone who was driving in the area and who may have dash-cam footage which could assist our investigation to contact us. "Anyone who can help is asked to call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 1638 of Friday, February 10, 2023."
I'm sorry, what? My friend recommended the mask of this line so I bought that, this conditioner, and the all in one milk. I cannot speak for the effectiveness of the product because the smell was just not tolerable. You know that musty smell old buildings use in female restrooms to try to mask the smell of *ladies* but it just turns out as this sour, chemical, kind of musty grandma smell? Ya that's all I can think of when I smell this. You know different strokes different folks so maybe you'll like the smell. My friend said it can help even the most damaged hair, so if you don't care about scent then no worries. I know natural products aren't going to smell as pretty as some synthetic ones but I feel like more and more natural lines just care less since it will sell anyway and so now everything just smells like playdough. I've lost a few favorite lines to them changing the formula to cheaper ingredients. I don't know if that's the case here or if this is a fake (which I called Davines and they said it isn't) but this smells like Y U C K and I had to return it.
The news that special counsel Jack Smith has subpoenaed Mike Pence raises the question: How will Team Trump use the courts to muck up this latest development in the Justice Department's probe? The short answer is that any attempt to scuttle the Pence subpoena on executive privilege grounds should fail. First off, there's a threshold question of whether a former president can even claim the privilege. Recall that Trump tried and failed to block the House Jan. 6 committee from getting White House records.

The tombs of Djehuty and Hery have been inaugurated on Thursday following the completion of restoration work. The inauguration was conducted by the Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Egypt Mostafa Waziri, Ambassador of Span to Egypt Alvaro Iranzo, and the President of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Eloísa del Pino. Waziri explained that the two tombs were discovered through the joint Egyptian-Spanish archaeological mission from the Supreme Council of Antiquities and CSIC, working since 2002. He said that the mission carried out excavation and restoration work and published research related to the tombs, which are located in the Dra Abu al-Naga area on the west bank of Luxor. They succeeded in uncovering many tombs, coffins, mummies and a funerary garden.
Humanity is out in 5 days. It's exciting, nerve-wracking, stressful, and all the good things that I love about working in games. What will people think of it? I like it but will it be able to attract an audience of the right players? Will a community blossom around the user-generated content piece of the game? (I am really hoping so.) The game's story, ideas and questions it inspires feel timely. Hoping things go well.

How would you share personal libraries?
The book was hard to keep up with as it jumped around a lot. Also the title doesn’t fit the story. The author indicated several people were infected by this alien, however left out may details on when or how it happened. I was confused at times and had to go back and re read a lot to make sure I didn’t miss anything.
(PERSON6) For the upcoming sessions and I've asked about demand because I've seen the (meme) project demo. They do offline subtitling. So, that's slightly easier than what we do. They still have the same segmentation issues and so on. But their mission in translation is shortening simply because the data is shortening. And that's because their target size is the subtitles, which are created for the hearing-impaired. So, there is like a natural shortening in the data. It'd be great if we could also locate such a type of data where there is some natural shortening happening. We would put it in the architecture.
Trump's Prized 40 Wall Street Building On 'Lender Watch' Amid Dropping Income: Report
So with a new #FFXIV raid tier approaching, I've long been thinking "man, I'd like to try proper raiding, but Party Finder sounds like a mess, and I'm never gonna find a static that'll have me."
But, after ~decades~ of reading next to nothing (with the exception of functional work-related non-fiction stuff and an occasional self-help book) I set a goal to read 23 books in 2023.
(PERSON8) I tried to, I guess two tokens and yeah like because in the first version, we had a suspicion that the token could be also tokenized itself, so then I replayed it with another token which is not only for this purpose because we used some pretrained dictionary, and this dictionary didn't contain separator tokens. So, I used some token that I assumed that it wouldn't be like tokenized into several pieces and so it will appear once. I had no guarantee that this token couldn't appear in other places in the sentence and that is the only place it could appear. So, it could be done more properly, yeah, I agree.

Confusing storyline
It has a slimmer design shape that fits better in the hands, there are no sharp corners to snag on and with the power cord as a permanent attachment, it's far less prone to damage than the original XB1 controller. The downsides are: 1) The vibration effect that is triggered in action gaming feels much weaker. 2) The controller's directional joystick and buttons wear out very quickly. We are very heavy handed and tend to wear out 2-3 controllers per year. So for us, making investments in controllers yearly means we have to be picky and prudent about what we purchase. The controller could do with more durable springs; after a couple months, buttons that are used the most stop responding and the right joystick loses it's centering, IE- makes map screens zoom in and characters walk forwards without even touching the controls.
Very nice looking guitar. Too bad the company does not know how to protect their product. Don’t bother trying to receive one that is not damaged. We returned 2 because of damages in shipping and the the 3rd one was damaged also. Gave up. They ship it in the soft thin case with one sheet of brown paper in a cardboard box. No padding at all.

One of the girls said, "That's what you get." "She loved life. She was the happiest kid. Everybody loved her," her father, Michael Kuch, told CBS New York on Thursday, adding that he's angry and wants everyone to see the video and what the teens did to his daughter.

Minnesota biologists rescue trapped black bear
As she went on to explain, there's method in a strategy that most people inside the Beltway would deem madness: This is the best way to earn the press's trust. They'll know we're not spinning like everyone else. SIGTARP will quickly become the only credible source for information in Washington about TARP. We might be embarrassed at times and disclose things that we could - and others would - easily hide, but we'll shock the press with our honesty. No one else does this, and before long, we'll have a built in defense when we're attacked. No matter what they hear, the press will come to us first and believe us, because we'll prove to them that we tell the truth. This is perhaps the biggest reason for Biden to pursue the course of radical responsibility-taking: Moments inevitably arise in any presidency when having the trust of the public and the institutions that safeguard the civic interest is critical. Moreover, there is vital capital to be earned by owning our mistakes, and there's an important distinction that Biden can draw with his political opponents. The president would do well to follow the old adage: Tell the truth - and shame the devil.
Forget me, fine. Ignore me, fine. It hurts but you gotta do you.
(PERSON1) Yeah, because I think it's a method which is very easy to test, and it always should be tested in contrast with the two encoders, and I would expect sometimes to be better and sometimes to be worse than the two encoders set up, depending on the exact task like what exactly is the second thing that you are encoding. So, maybe if you have two copies two paraphrases of the same sentence, maybe it is somehow confusing for the attention so whatever, I don't know. Behaviour also could be different for the old sequence-to-sequence methods, compared to transformer, so for RNN then it behaved differently maybe with transformer it's yeah, it's harder to train so maybe you need to whatever increase warm-ups number, warm-up sets.

I only have good things to say about this gift bag set. I was able to wrap all of my Christmas gifts with the bags, gift wrap and tissue paper. The product is great quality and the different size options make it easier to choose the perfect one for every gift! I highly recommend it. The seller is absolutely sweet and attentive. He reached out to me after my purchase to make sure I was happy with my product. 5 stars all the way around!
(PERSON8) No, I have not processed it. So [PERSON1] said that, once, they get the transcript, we will do it together.
I quite like akkoma the software and the domain name I got for my instance. But I feel somehow I started this instance on the wrong foot, so to speak. And I never got comfy there. Will still linger a bit longer on here and think about whether I should migrate at all.

Intersex is even recognized by TERFs and the like because it's generally more physical and, as such, visible. In the same way that mental health is seen as less "real" than physical health by many, I kind of feel that being trans is merely intersex of the mind.
Biden DOJ 'Doesn't Want an Armed Citizenry'
(PERSON17) Yeah, so for the multi-accent English. So, we are now [PERSON14] putting that together to just one technical solution. The current idea that [PERSON14] is working on is that he will create new sentences with words that were spoken in other sentences, and he will do this across different speakers. So, it will be really multi-speaker sentences, and therefore the robustness to the different accents of these speakers could be also improved. Ah, so that's one particle experiment. And later on, we may do something more about the multi-accent thing. So, these new sentences will actually try to solve two problems with one experiment. One problem is the implicit language model. So, the ASR system has to see the largest possible set of sentences. And we are going to create new sentences from the text-only language model by adding the sound part to that, so that the language model will be better for the ASR, and the robustness to different speakers would be also better. And in a talk yesterday, I heard another idea. It was during the training. They were dropping out time bands and frequency bands from the sound. So, they were training on disrupted inputs, and that also greatly improved the robustness of the system.
(fwiw, I've tried nearly every "humane" trap on the market with very little success. I'm not especially happy with killing them, but I won't be taking comments on the ethics of killing mice.)
(PERSON4) And I think only two or three sentences were correctly inflected in the incorrect context, like the translation was wrong. And then there are some cases where the translation was totally wrong, because the sentence was really wrong, and the part must be <unintelligible/>, but that was just like one or two cases.
(PERSON11) That is important. Please write this down here into the documenter this <unintelligible/> summary, because that is for [PERSON2]. And also [PERSON2], when you talk to [PERSON10], well and also possibly [PERSON5]. If we have this tool, we need to (ship) the audio to multiple ASR or multiple workers <unintelligible/> We will separately need to (ship) the audio to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR and the Czech ASR, for example depending on the <other_noise/> And also, to this language ID worker and then we need to merge these outputs, and this is tool which we do not have yet. That's the multi-source tool, which will be observing the text outputs and also following the time stamps and it would emit the - it would probably like produce the output into three separate language channels for using either silence or the correct ASR. So, we need a filter for the ASRs, so that the ASR is silent if it's the wrong language and it is the recognized text if it's the correct language. I just made it up this type of setup. Another of setup would be that same sound is shipped to ASR and this language checker. This language checker is essentially a part of the ASR, silencing the ASR if it's the wrong language. That's also an option. So, we need to figure out which way of integrating the language ID is the best for our purposes. So, please keep thinking about this like what are our pipelines. Ideally, I think that the least like management confusion and so on would arise if our MT models were multilingual. If they supported different source languages and they were translating from any of these languages into English. Possibly doing just a copy, if the English was given as the input, so we would have multi-lingual multiple ASRs at the beginning. All going into English, and then from the English will go into all of the languages. And later when [PERSON12] would have multi-lingual model of ASR, that language ID would not even be needed.
(PERSON1) Oh well, one of them was yesterday for me.

The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching as you settle the flyer down on the red soil, but they make no move towards you, in fact they are motionless as you climb out of the flyer and walk slowly towards them. The ground beneath your feet begins to tremble and then shake, as if in an earthquake and you lose your footing, though the Repnids seem unaffected. The rock beneath you gives way suddenly. Repnids have tunnelled below the surface and you fall into a boiling mass of hundreds of Repnid bodies in a cavern below. The end is swift, as several pairs of fangs inject their deadly venom and the air of Dyskra contaminates your lungs. Nobody will ever know that you were the first human future traveller.
The more I read of studies on sex, gender, psychology, the more the statement of "My sex is male, my gender is female" seems simplistic and inaccurate. It almost seems like ceding part of an argument to TERFs. I feel that to be trans is to be "biologically non-binary". My sex is non-binary, my gender is female.
"Antonio Conte has complained about the defending and this player, at the moment is struggling to defend. He is up against very good players in Barnes and Maddison but it is very disappointing." While the goal was ruled out, Leicester restored their 4-1 lead with Barnes on target nine minutes from full-time. Despite beating Manchester City last week, Tottenham missed the chance to move ahead of Newcastle into third place.

I asked the seller if the color was too yellow before buying and was told it's like antique gold, darker. Nothing close! The set looks VERY cheap. It's super shiny yellow with lots of CZs, even shinier. Looks great on the photo, but in real life I wouldn't even give it to a teenager to wear.

The battery life is terrible on the one I bought on Amazon. Still can’t believe Logitech discontinued this remote, nothing else comes close in comparison. I absolutely LOVE this Harmony remote, this is my 4th one. Dog chewed up the first one, husband kneeled on the screen of the second one, and the third ones still working but there’s an elbow mark in the middle of the touch screen also courtesy of the hubby...bought this one as a back up and the screens great but the battery it came with holds a charge maybe for a couple days. My original (3rd one) keeps a charge for weeks at a time and I use my remote for everything.

Africans made up the third largest group of immigrants in Oslo, with 28,020 people from Africa living in Oslo. Europeans from countries that aren't part of the UK, EU or EEA were the fourth largest group, accounting for 15,566 Oslo residents. From here, the size of the groups drops significantly. For example, there were just shy of 7,000 citizens from South American countries in 2022, while there was a smidge over 3,000 nationals hailing from North and Central America. Meanwhile, there were less than 700 people from Oceania in Oslo.
I purchased these in February. Recently I tried to use them and unfortunately each time I try one my Keurig machine gives me an error message that the pod is not compatible with my machine. I have been using Donut Shop pods in my machine since I first purchased it and have never had a problem. Upon closer examination of the coffee pod, I noticed that the code printed on the top of the pod isn't very legible so I can only assume that I have a bad box. I purchased a box of 72 which is 6 boxes of 12 each. I have even tried one from each of the 6 boxes and keep getting the same error message. I know it's not my machine because other pods I try work just fine. It's only out of this shipment that I am having this issue. Very disappointing since my return window has expired. UPDATE: I talked to a customer representative who refunded by money. Thank you AMAZON for your wonderful customer support!

Im giving it 3 stars for now, i don't want leave a bad review for the seller unless he deserves it but this drone overheats a lot. Im not sure if i should contact the seller or dji tello themselves but ill probably try both just to see what they say. I like the drone is a cool little toy that fly's better than some bigger older drones and some of my bigger drones feel more like a toy than this one. However its the only drone i have ever had overheating issues with and it actually takes the fun out of flying im going to assume for now that its a manufacturing issue which they need to address asap if they want there product to be successful. I really hope the seller did not send me a use drone as i paid for a new one. I will give the sellers props for delivery as it arrive 1 day after purchase. I will update date my review after contacting seller and dji tello.

(PERSON2) And my idea is that a client clicks this microphone button and starts to speak, and when the user is speaking, you send the audio in small chunks at the same time. Let's say 200 or even 100 milliseconds. And to the HTTP server put it to a queue which I will handle the queue later with (ASR). And the model will do some logic, some inference with that. And whenever it has a new piece of transcript, it will send it back, and the user should get the partial transcript back. And it should be immediately displayed in the text field.
(PERSON7) Yeah, yeah, this is very important to parallelize everything actually, parallelize both the processing of the systems as well as the evaluation of the cell DF, because he would need to run this many times, there will be errors, you need to re-run this quickly.
(PERSON4) Yep thanks.

Echidna with amethyst and magenta spikes. They are average height, has an average build and muscular. Their tail is extremely thick. Their hair is raspberry, short and curly. Their eyes are pear and they wear scarlet cateye glasses. Their most interesting feature is their good deeds.
Playing around a bit with Flutter. I'd hate to base my business on tech from Google, to be honest, on the other hand Google is one of the few big players with real incentives to create a compelling cross platform experience and it shows.
Abe keeps his sorrows hidden and laughs easily while Tom is not afraid to cry but is less amused by rude humor. Jan will hurt you before she lets you see she's hurt and laughs most when things are upside-down. Mio knows that sorrow is life's constant companion.
I was disappointed upon receiving this item as the silver part that goes around the face appeared to be made of some sort of cheap plastic. It's not the fact that it was made of plastic that disappointed me as much as the fact that the plastic used made it look incredibly cheap. For me, this detail ruined the whole look for me. I also did not trust it to hold up to everyday wear so I ended up returning it. I was disappointed because it seemed like it would have been a good deal if it had not been for that. However, it you can overlook that, then it might be right for you. It was packaged well and did arrive quickly.
I'm tired of conservative parties and governments wrapping themselves in the brand of pro-business. They aren't, at least not in Alberta.
Tim Sherwood tears into £44m signing Pedro Porro after dismal Tottenham debut
You land the flyer nose upward on the side of the slag heap and climb out. The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching, but they make no move towards you, in fact they are motionless as you walk slowly towards them. You halt while still on the mound of crumbled rock and soil and speak to them, saying, 'I come in peace, as a friend.' It appears that they cannot hear you, let alone understand, as your Universal Translator picks up no answer. You decide to use your Psychic Awareness to contact them mentally. It is difficult to make sense of their thoughts; they are terrifyingly alien and your mind recoils from the contact. You decide that establishing contact again would be dangerous and return to your flyer, but the experience has cleared your mind which had been befuddled ever since you jumped into the future. Once back in Falcon's Wing you find it quite easy to plot a course for Earth in 3034 AD. Note that you have used up another polybdenum rod as you jump.
(PERSON1) I mean for text flow, we use something like Hypercore, but I'm not sure if that would work for this.
Had a recent graduate artist take some critique badly tonight. In part, because they'd be taught badly. But it's important to not make excuses for issues and just fix them, especially in production when your lead needs changes. Especially with the competition.
I purchased this lamp to supplement the light my new vegetable seedlings were getting from the window. I love many of the features of these lights. Pros: First, they clamp easily onto my shelf, and bend to many positions allowing me to make changes as my plants grow. The lights are cool to the touch, and haven't cause harm even when touching the plants. I believe my veggies have benefited from the lights. The lights are dimmable, but I use the strongest setting only. I have not made use of the timer, preferring to turn them on and off myself. I can see this feature as useful in an office setting with houseplants or if on vacation Cons: I do not believe these lights are strong enough to be the primary light source for nursery plants. The lights are small! When the lights burn out, I will have to buy a whole new unit.
I wanna see these companies that intermediate transactions explain to their customers how they set their percentages. They're not gonna talk about this on Bloomberg! But if Spotify has a good quarter, they will.

(PERSON1) Yeah, I think that he told us in the beginning of the semester that well if we want a one (??) you'll get a one. Just within the second deadline, you should submit it. That's pretty much the only thing he asked. But he also told us that judging by previous years' trends, a lot of people don't do that. They find it easier to read for the exam. No, sorry, study for the exam-

Kazakh Prime minister Smailov expressed special gratitude to the President of the Asian Athletics Association Dahlan al-Hamad for his assistance in preparing for and holding the championships. The Asian Athletics Indoor Championships take place for the first time in the CIS territory. The tournament brought together over 500 athletes from 31 countries who are to compete in race, relay race, long jump, high jump, triple jump, pole vault, shot put, and all-around event. The tournament is to run through February 12. Earlier it was reported Kazakhstani runner Caroline Chepkoech Kipkirui won the women's 3,000m gold, and Olga Safronova claimed the women's 60m silver at the tournament.

Remote work is enabling. It enables people to work in comfortable spaces and not stuffy, noisy offices. It enables accessibility for anyone with an internet connection and a good working space. It enables people to avoid lengthy commutes that take time away from their day and their families.
It's a thing I've never said before either.

I was fortunate enough to spend a memorable six months alongside Nicholas in 2011 supporting a range of projects. When we caught up at the weekend I was chuffed to hear about progress, particularly with tree planting and farm support. Thousands of trees have been established and farmers have seen increased crop yields through a range of interventions from support with equipment purchases to training.
This is a very nice skirt. The lacy pattern is classy and soft. It doesn't wrinkle, even after being crammed into plastic and a box it was very smooth, so that's really cool. This can easily be dressed down or dressed up, and has a kind of vintage feel due to the length and cut, which I'm really into. I think this could be flattering on anyone. I'm 5'5" and 130 pounds and I ordered the small, so I would say if you feel like you're stuck between a small and medium, definitely size down.
President's Cup: Candystripes defeat Rovers in season opener at Brandywell
(PERSON6) Yeah, I was maybe just thinking about like what kinds of data we currently use for this, because, for example, like if you check like [ORGANIZATION4]'s models on [ORGANIZATION5] that they are like already pretty good at these things -
A 16-year-old boy has been charged with murder in the fatal shooting of two students at a Chicago high school in December, police announced Friday. The suspect is charged with two counts of felony first-degree murder and two counts of felony attempted murder, Chicago Police superintendent David Brown announced. "We currently don't have a clear motive for why a 16 year old would want to shoot and kill other kids," Brown said. The suspect's name was not released Friday due to his age, although Brown said he would face the murder and attempted murder charges as an adult.
Statistics Norway's figures showed that foreigners were scattered all over the city's districts, as Søndre Nordstrand, the borough furthest south in Oslo, had over 14,000 immigrants registered there. Many immigrants also lived in sought-after areas, as Frogner was the district with the fifth most foreigners. After that, Stovner, Bjerke, Grorud, Østensjø and Sagene made up the rest of the ten districts in Oslo with the most residents from another country.

The owner of the Russian Wagner Group private military contractor actively involved in the fighting in Ukraine has predicted that the war could drag on for years. Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video interview released late Friday that it could take 18 months to two years for Russia to fully secure control of Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland of Donbas. He added that the war could go on for three years if Moscow decides to capture broader territories east of the Dnieper River.
(PERSON6) And I think that if we just like - We could probably just get the data from them, because you have like a such a large set of videos basically with different domains and different speaker native languages on [ORGANIZATION5]. And I had this idea that we could just like use some tool to download basically some kinds of filtered videos from [ORGANIZATION5] and make training tests a training set out of them.

Thank you to those people who have downloaded the latest update to Leasey. A few very small difficulties have come to light. Nothing to set alarm bells ringing but nevertheless they are being addressed. A small update will be produced next week to correct them. Most of yesterday was spent installing the new update for some customers, and everyone who does need that assistance should have received it by now. Have a good day!
Now, I get that in practice, IDirectXObject2 is typically a proper superset of IDirectXObject, with no changed function signatures, and new methods only added to the end. But this is not universally true; for those cases it matters what interface you are using to create the object in question.

GAZIANTEP.KAZINFORM - Kazakh rescuers continue digging through the rubble searching for survivors in Türkiye, Kazinform cites the press service of the Kazakh Emergency Situations Ministry. The work of the rescuers is hampered by large amounts of debris and unstable constructions. As of now, the Kazakhstani rescue team pulled out seven quake survivors and the bodies of 19 people, including one kid, in Türkiye. First medical aid is also provided on a round-the-clock basis. Notably, a 7.7 magnitude quake that devastated parts of southeast Türkiye and northern Syria hit early Monday. As of today, the death toll from massive quakes hit the southeast of Türkiye exceeded 20,000.
In our day-to-day lives, we're constantly looking for ways to increase our energy and avoid burnout, especially in our jobs. This can be extremely difficult for those in the healthcare industry, which is why I asked 30 health and wellness professionals the same question: "How do you manage your energy and not burn out in your profession?" Their careers range from infectious disease doctors to psychologists to mindfulness teachers - and they all had great advice to give on how to stay motivated and keep the ball rolling. Despite the large differences in their roles, there were several themes within their responses that stood out as ways to prevent burnout.
Russia suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in the fall when the Ukrainian military launched successful counteroffensives to reclaim broad swaths of territory in the east and the south. The Kremlin has avoided making forecasts on how long the fighting could continue, saying that what it called the "special military operation" will continue until its goals are fulfilled. The Russian forces have focused on Ukraine's Luhansk and Donetsk provinces that make up the Donbas region where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014.
I had bleached my whole head and then dyed over it with a black box dye a few months ago. I then went and had highlights put in all over my head. A few weeks later I put blue/green Arctic Fox hair dye on my hair and it would not fade out. I used this stuff with Olaplex No. 3 and it lightened TREMENDOUSLY all over, removing the green and blue parts as well as lifting the dark box dye. However, after a day I noticed a green tint to my hair. Every day it gets worse and I have used the color extractor twice now, with the same results. My hair is also getting darker where the box dye was. This is a great product it just doesn't seem to last.
One person has been arrested amid a protest outside Tate Britain, where a drag queen storytelling event for children was being hosted. The Metropolitan police said one person was arrested on suspicion of making a racially aggravated comment towards a police officer outside the art gallery near Westminster. No injuries have been reported and officers remain at the scene, the force said.

And then, I agree that there is a lot of noise in this dictionary. So, I asked that you would have various versions of this dictionary by taking only the words that were observed, five times. And only the pronunciations that were observed three times or more, or something like that. So, that way, these random errors, such as the example with this four IBM instead of IBM. This will not be so frequent. But still, you will have the variants in pronunciation, because if the person, says this "alzo", if you remember, if he says this "alzo" with a "Z" 20 times in the in the talk, then you will see that in the data with the "Z". And if he sometimes manages to say also correctly, then yeah, again, you will see that in the data. So, I would like, [PERSON4] to be in touch with [PERSON2]. Maybe you continue on the call, right? I will have to leave now, because I need to give the kids lunch and so on. But please stay on this call and figure out jointly how to use that dictionary. So [PERSON4], please show [PERSON2] what the dictionary is that the system is accepting. Share your screen and show it. And [PERSON2], please, have a look at that and help with converting the dictionary that you emitted to that file. One thing that will still be needed is the language model substitute. But all these words should be known words. So [PERSON4], you need to figure out what words are in the language model. And the words which are in the language model should be simply copied. So, the dictionary will have three col ns. The grapheme, as it is output. One recognized. The phonemes, as [PERSON2] proposed. And there will be multiple lines with different phoneme variations. And the third col n will be also the same again for all of those, and again there will be the same grapheme form. So that is when the language model sees. And I think that this way, these systems should be able to load it. And you will also possibly run into one more problem: that it is not ready for two big custom dictionaries. So, this is also something that has to be tested, but please test it, the two of you together. So [PERSON2] knows what he created in the dictionary. And you know what the dictionary looks like when you are creating it manually, and you need to put these two pieces of knowledge together. Ah, so that it works with the, with the generated dictionary.

Every artist has been there, made the same mistakes. Good critique is there to correct the problem quickly, and isn't directed at your ability. It's assuming you have the ability to fix the problem, or find a solution.

3 1/2 Stars Remedy is a brothers best friend romance as well as a second chance romance mixed into one. It's a unique story, and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to get Collins back and prove he's the guy for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an amazing night together. Collins thought she was finally getting everything she dreamed of, her brothers best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning, and never heard from her, things definitely changed. Now Grady is back, and he's not leaving, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left, and that he's not giving her up this time around. While I loved the premise of this story, and at times Grady, he really got on my nerves. I totally understand his reasoning for leaving that night, but to not even send a letter to Collins explaining himself? To leave her wondering and hurt for all those years, and then expect her to welcome him back with open arms? Was he delusional?! Collins was right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She was right to put up a fight with him when he wanted her back and to move forward. I admire her will power, because Grady was persistent. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong, and she guarded her heart, and I admired her for that. Sure she loved Grady, but she was scared, and hesitant to let him back in her life, who wouldn't be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite out of the two. She definitely let things go at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There is a lot of angst in this book, and I did enjoy watching these two reconnect when Collins started to forgive Grady, I just wish Grady would have not come off as so whiney and would have been a little more understanding. He kept saying he understood, but at times he was a little too pushy to me, and then he was sweet towards the end. I ended up loving him just as much as Collins, but in the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his points of view because I couldn't connect with his character. The first part of this book, was not my favorite, but he second part? I adored, hence my rating. If you like second chance, and brothers best friend romances, you may really enjoy this book, I just had a hard time with Grady at first and how he handled some of the things he did.
But did I love it? Absolutely!
Derry City emerged victorious in the President's Cup as they ran out 2-0 winners over Shamrock Rovers. The FAI Cup holders defeated last season's league winners at the Brandywell thanks to first-half goals from Will Patching and Michael Duffy. The Hoops pushed to reduced terms in the second half but Ruaidhri Higgins' charges stood firm to win the curtain-raiser. Derry travel to St. Patrick's Athletic for the league opener next Friday. Patching's side-footed volley nudged Derry in front after 23 minutes - the midfielder opened the scoring as the Foylesider's ran out 2-1 winners over the eventual champions last February.
There has been particular unhappiness that Leigh Drennan, the chair of Labour North West and aide to the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting Warrington North MP Charlotte Nichols, was not longlisted to try to win the seat back from the Conservatives, despite garnering nominations from four big trade unions. Reeves said she had nothing to do with candidate selection, but added: "I do know that it's really important that we have rigorous processes for who can be longlisted and who can be shortlisted."
In recent years, certain Hindu hard-liners have raided shops selling Valentine's Day items, burned cards and gifts, and chased hand-holding couples out of restaurants and parks, insisting that the day goes against traditional values and promotes promiscuity. Hindu nationalist groups such as Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal have said such raids help reassert a Hindu identity. Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi say his government has pushed a Hindu agenda, seeking the religion's supremacy in a secular nation known for its diversity. While Hindus comprise almost 80% of the nearly 1.4 billion people, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains account for most of the rest.

It's ThinkPad day!! Came home on my lunch break to see this sitting outside uwu. Wish I could take it back to work with me to setup more. But that will have to wait till tonight.
Avoid Wifi connection- go Bluetooth! I purchased this for my wife in October, 2017. At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel. I couldn't get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel. I decided to wait until we moved into our home and I could set up my own Wifi system. March 2018- I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won't connect. Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10' away from the Wifi unit. I followed the YouTube setup video with no success. When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone. This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone! I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection. Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale.
(PERSON1) and then, we'll figure out which packages to install in the Petri environment.
Wazir explained that these two tombs belong to prominent people, who lived during the beginning of the 18th dynasty of the New Kingdom - one of the most important eras of ancient Egypt. He said that the layout of the tombs are T-shaped, a style commonly used in tombs from the 18th dynasty. These consistent of an entrance, a column hall leading to a burial shaft, and walls featuring distinct inscriptions. Waziri added that Djehuty was supervisor of the state treasury and overviewed works of craftsmen and artists during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut.

The O'Mara circumstances were "pretty exceptional," said Reeves, but she acknowledged: "There are important lessons to be learned for the Labour party and all political parties on the selection of candidates. But I would also say, in this parliament we have seen the constant undermining of standards in politics, not least by a succession of prime ministers and fines and parties and standards falling well short of what you could expect." She added: ""One thing I would say about the Labour party is that when people do wrong, they lose the whip. And that's just not the case in the Conservative party."
(PERSON6) So this is an important thing that we should have come across months ago. Remember, it is since August that I've been telling you that we want to evaluate on a later test set. And every time, you all... It is not just you personally, [PERSON8]. There were other things, obviously. But every time you thought about that, you thought "this will be easy, we will just run it". And only when you actually do it, do you see all the problems. So, this is known, common. It is always like that. So that's a message for everybody. Before you try, you never know what the problem will be. So, for example, the call that I had, in which someone was interviewing me, so they wanted to record the video. Zoom never worked as badly for me as it did today for the recording. So, before you do it, you cannot say whether it will work or not. And here we are running into the problems of conversion of the file formats. So, hopefully, we will be able to quickly get the numbers. So, do you have any word error rates so far?
Discovered the hard way that in 2023, local TV station web sites are the absolute worst experience on the internet. Popups, auto-play videos, animations, popovers, and ads, ads, ads. I know that advertising is how they make their money, but all that garbage seems counterproductive if it drives people away. This is true even now that goatse.cx is gone, though it would be a close race to the bottom between goatse and, say, khou.com, where I tried to watch a video the Wendy sent me.
(PERSON3) I guess that is actually like an interesting question whether we can use the constraints to enforce this kind of the like gender of the speaker in the in the translation.
Jami slipped the note to him when they passed each other on the path, just before the dog watch. She was on her way to the wall, he was coming off duty. He glanced behind him to watch her go, and to make sure they hadn't been seen. She did not look back. He waited until he was in the darkness of the bunk room before he pulled the note out and read it in a beam of light coming through the blackout curtains. One block-printed word. He spent a long time staring at it, trying to stay calm:
1 of the fans sounded out of balance out of the box. The speed controls are really wonky -- If you dial them to 100% the fans will shut off, so you need to turn it to 100% then dial it back slowly until the come back on. Build quality is mediocre, but this seems to be par for most of these types of product at this price point. The feet for holding the laptop up when it's inclined have snapped off a few times... They go back in, but it happens enough to be annoying. On a positive note, this has ideal fan placement for laptops that intake air from vents located near the top of the laptop. Many other coolers have fans toward the middle and provide very little additional airflow to a laptop with such a cooling configuration.
(PERSON2) Yeah, when it has short context and because I make decisions based on very short context for this very low latency, then it really commits to something that in, for example, a second or two, it figures out oh, well, actually this was bad translation. So, it tries to use a different wording. To, for example, specify the thing. So actually, I really liked it. I like some of the translations. I was really amazed, even though you could see that the model made mistakes on its first try, it really wanted to make some kind of correction. And it definitely sounded really fluent, which I think is also important. If you really demand low latency, then then I think that even a slightly lower quality is fine, if the fluency is good. Because if you have bad translation quality and bad fluency, then I think that the translation is just pointless. But if the lower quality is because the translation, if you read everything that you will get the same information, but the wording is just poor, because it used, for example, more words and it used some corrections and stuff. So, I think that this is completely fine for simultaneous, as long as you don't lose any information. And for which language pairs do you have these results, like some examples? Because I would like to look at it, just out of curiosity.

It's weird doing weightlifting but also having no real clue what your one-rep-max is, cus that's one of the key ways people track their progress. I work out alone in my bedroom without a spotter or even a weight rack. Just me and a barbell with a bunch of weights. I bench press on my bed. If I try and figure out my one rep max is I might not own enough weights to max out, or conversely it could seriously injure/kill me. Anyway, load is going up today. Still feels good.

The incident comes after increase in numbers of refugees and asylum seekers crossing the Channel to the UK in boats. Police have arrested 15 people after an anti-refugee demonstration outside a hotel used to house asylum seekers turned violent near the English city of Liverpool. The Merseyside Police department said a police officer and two civilians sustained minor injuries during the disturbance on Friday night in Knowsley. The police force said some protesters threw objects and set a police van on fire. The people arrested, who ranged in age from 13 to 54, were detained "following violent disorder." Merseyside police commissioner Emily Spurrell told Radio City, "It was incredibly dangerous and there were a couple of injuries amongst the police officers."
