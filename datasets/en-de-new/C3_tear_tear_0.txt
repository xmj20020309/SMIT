I swear, five years ago burrata didn't exist.
I'm not exactly sure why my brain can't figure it out; it could be because the tools are simply so comprehensive and vague that my brain is simply overwhelmed by 'too many possibilities'.
Because for Interspeech, we could also divide it up paper by paper. So that some papers would go into the Interspeech proceedings. And some of our submitted papers would be submitted later to the PBML proceedings. And the authors would be free to choose. So we have to negotiate this with either SIGDial or Interspeech. If it's okay with you to have some of our papers, provided those papers are submitted by the March deadline. So there's an absolute strict requirement. And I think they can't have anything against that. Because if the paper is worth publishing. So yeah, it's just a bonus that the paper contains some shared task results that appear at the satellite event. So, yeah, I think it's okay. So we don't have to ask for a special session. At Interspeech it's called special session, we don't want that. At Interspeech we want the satellite event. But we will tell our people: If you manage to have your paper ready by the Interspeech deadline, submit it as an Interspeech paper, and you will have it within Interspeech. Ah, if you don't make it for the Interspeech deadline, here is our deadline. And that's for PBML.
My neighbor and I got home at the same time and I could hear him coughing up a storm of Covid mucus from across the street. So I rushed to get into my apartment to avoid him, but he still managed to catch up with me for a chat. I swear, people infected with Covid are zombies trying to infect everyone else.
Yes, I just did the same thing.
This would mainly be for surfing the internet, occasional email writing, and some games.
(PERSON10) Okay, so just one question from me to make sure. When concatenating the sentences, you insert the sentence separator, right? You have a special token to distinguish what the source is and what the context or the other sentence is, or do you just concatenate them without any separator and hope the system learns to distinguish them?
Donald Trump's heavily mortgaged skyscraper at 40 Wall Street is under the lenders' scrutiny as revenues plummet and costs rise, Bloomberg reported Friday. The vacancy rate at the 72-story building - Trump's most valuable - rose to nearly 18% in the third quarter of last year, according to a monthly report on the building's remaining $126.5 million mortgage, per Bloomberg. Spending had reportedly increased 11% since the mortgage began in 2015. Trump has often boasted about the building, which he acquired in 1995 and was valued at $540 million in 2015.
Loved the ring - but couldn't wear it all the time! :( This ring was beautiful. I loved the design and the solid look; it looked expensive and was very comfortable! The only reason I gave only 3 stars and eventually returned the product is that I found I couldn't wear it all the time. I like to wear my rings all the time, so I always make sure to buy sterling silver, and I know some people said their rings corroded after a while, but I had worn mine continuously for about a week - even when washing my hands - and hadn't noticed any corrosion. Interestingly, the problem was that the inner band of the ring actually made my finger turn white and moist - similar to a band-aid when you wear it for an extended period of time. This happened even when I made sure the ring and my finger were completely dry. I don't know why this happened and had never had it with any other ring, but it became uncomfortable, so I decided it wasn't the right ring for me. :( Too bad, because I really liked it! So if you're buying this ring with the intention of only wearing it occasionally, I say: Go for it!! You won't be disappointed!
Oh yes, I just don't know if you caught it when I was talking about [PERSON1], but one thing is that the improvement is better, but the other thing is that the lemmas are actually manually inflected correctly, but that's a different issue, not a problem. It's actually good that it's <unintelligible/>, yeah. So, I thought it could be. But I'm not sure if we have test data for that. We could try to play around with the models with some kind of style transfer. You know, we can use a constraint and try to use a synonym constraint instead and see or compare the difference between the outputs. I'm just describing it vaguely because I myself don't have an exact idea of how to do it, but it could have been an interesting, standalone scenario. I don't know, [PERSON1], do you know anything about style transfer data for English-Czech? Do we have something like that?
I haven't actually achieved anything. I'm glad that a few people came to me privately and said "look, because of all your work, I'm going to grant you this amount of money".
At the other end of the spectrum, only 184 foreign residents called Marka home, and slightly more than 700 lived in the central city district. Ullern, Vestre Aker, and Nordstrand were the other districts with the fewest foreign residents. However, significantly more immigrants lived in these districts than in downtown Oslo and Marka. Those from EU and EEA countries as well as from the United Kingdom mostly lived in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo, and St. Hanshaugen. While many citizens from Asia, including Turkey, also lived in Gamle Oslo (5,837), the majority were registered as residents of the Alna, Stovner, and Søndre Nordstrand districts.
On the day of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 which destroyed the World Trade Center and cost 3,000 people their lives, Trump boasted in a television interview that 40 Wall Street was suddenly the highest building in the city. His claim was not only insensitive, it was also a lie.
The disgraced former MP Jared O'Mara "should never have been selected as a Labour candidate" and deserves his four-year jail sentence, the treasurer said. Speaking to the Guardian in Bolton North East constituency on Friday, hours after key figures in the local party had resigned in protest at how Labour's national executive committee (NEC) was controlling the parliamentary selection process for the next general election, Rachel Reeves said:
This is a very brief sketch of a plausible argument that theories of capitalism which influence the actual content of science are compatible with theories that assert the existence of objective scientific facts. It is *not* an argument for the existence of objective scientific facts, in which I do not believe.

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources came to the aid of an unfortunate bear after he had been trapped in a ditch. According to a Facebook post by the agency, the bear had crawled into a culvert next to the road near Wannaska, Minnesota. But, as the snow began to melt, the culvert began to flood, trapping the bear in deep snow and ice, the agency said. Agency staff quickly rushed to the scene and assisted in the rescue of the bear. The agency's bear biologist, Andrew Tri, "examined the bear and declared it healthy but groggy - obviously from being awakened from its hibernation," the Facebook post said. The agency then transported the bear to a state wildlife sanctuary to continue its hibernation. The sleepy predator was estimated to be 6 years old and weigh between 170 and 181 kilograms.
I liked Collins... It took a while for Grady to grow on me.

(PERSON6) So [PERSON2], does that make sense to you?
According to TMZ, Kilcher hired the two in September. Kilcher had her breakthrough with Terrence Malick's 2002 film "The New World", in which she portrayed Pocahontas. She also appeared in "Sons of Anarchy", "The Alienist", and "Dora and the Lost City of Gold". Most recently, she co-starred in the road movie "Dog" with Channing Tatum.

Modrow, a reform-oriented communist, took over East Germany shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall and later invited opposition forces into the government, but could not slow down the growing momentum of German reunification. "The entire peaceful process of bringing about German unity was indeed his special achievement," the Left Party wrote on Twitter. "That will remain his political legacy." During his 16 years as SED party leader in Dresden, starting in 1973, Modrow earned a reputation as a politician who opposed the establishment. He rejected party privileges and insisted on living in a normal apartment.
I'm back baby!
(PERSON8) I don't remember exactly, but it's like when I started with these multi-source experiments in the summer. The first thing I started with was concatenating the paraphrase and the source. Maybe I, I don't remember now, I can check by the next meeting if I also tried. I definitely tried if the sources come first, followed by a separator and the paraphrase second. I may have also tried randomly swapping the order of the two things, yes, and I just remember that it extensively tested the mutual interaction and tried out multi-encoder.

A pedestrian has died following a collision with a car in Fife. The 38-year-old woman was taken to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy after the collision on Broad Street in Cowdenbeath at about 13:30 on Friday. A 24-year-old man has since been arrested in connection with the collision. Police are asking witnesses or those with dashcam footage to come forward. Sergeant Lee Walkingshaw said: "Our investigations are ongoing and we are asking anyone who was in the area at the time of the collision and witnessed the collision to contact us. I would also ask anyone who was driving in the area around the time and may have dashcam footage which could assist our inquiries to contact us. Anyone who can help is asked to call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 1638 of Friday, 10 February 2023."
Excuse me, come again? My friend recommended the mask from this line, so I bought it, this conditioner, and the all-in-one milk. I can't speak to the effectiveness of the product because the smell was just unbearable. You know that musty smell old buildings use in ladies' restrooms to mask the smell of *ladies*, but it just comes across as this sour, chemical, kind of musty grandma smell? Yeah, that's all I can think of when I smell it. You know, different tastes, different people, maybe you like the smell. My friend said it could fix even the most damaged hair, so if you don't mind the scent, then no worries. I know natural products won't smell as pretty as some synthetic ones, but I feel like more and more natural lines just don't care as much since it'll sell anyway and now everything just smells like modeling clay. I've lost a few favorite lines because they changed the formula to cheaper ingredients. I don't know if that's the case here or if this is a counterfeit, which is why I called Davines and they said it wasn't, but it reeks to high heaven and I had to return it.
The news that special counsel Jack Smith has subpoenaed Mike Pence raises the question: How will Trump's team use the courts to obstruct this latest development in the Justice Department's investigation? The short answer is that any attempt to thwart Pence's subpoena on executive privilege grounds should fail. First of all, there is the question of whether a former president can even claim the privilege in the first place. Recall that Trump tried to prevent the January 6 House Committee from getting access to White House documents, and failed.

The tombs of Djehuty and Hery were inaugurated on Thursday after the completion of the restoration work. The inauguration was carried out by the Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Egypt, Mostafa Waziri, the Spanish Ambassador to Egypt, Alvaro Iranzo, and the President of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Eloísa del Pino. Waziri stated that the two tombs were discovered by the joint Egyptian-Spanish archaeological mission of the Supreme Council of Antiquities and the CSIC, which has been active since 2002. He said that the mission carried out excavation and restoration work and published research related to the tombs, which are located in the Dra Abu al-Naga area on the west bank of Luxor. They succeeded in uncovering many tombs, coffins, mummies, and a funerary garden.
"Humanity" is releasing in 5 days. It's exciting, nerve-wracking, stressful, and all the good things I love about working in the games industry. What will people think of it? I like it, but will it be able to attract an audience of the right players? Will a community form around the user-generated content part of the game? —I really hope so.— The game's story, the ideas and questions it raises, feel timely. I hope everything goes well.

How would you share personal libraries?
The book was hard to follow as it jumped around a lot. The title doesn't fit the story. The author implied that multiple people were infected by this alien, but left out many details about when or how it happened. I was confused at times and had to frequently go back and re-read to ensure I hadn't missed anything.
(PERSON6), For the upcoming sessions, I asked about the demand after I saw the demo of the (meme) project. They do offline subtitling. So it's a bit easier than what we do. They still have the same segmentation problems and so on. But their translation mission just gets shorter because the data gets shorter. And that's because their target size is the subtitles that are created for the hearing impaired. So there's a natural shortening of the data. It would be great if we could also find that kind of data where a natural shortening happens. We would build it into the architecture.

With a new #FFXIV raid tier in sight, I've been thinking for a long time: "Man, I'd love to try real raiding, but Party Finder sounds like a mess and I'll never find a static group that will take me in."
But after decades of reading almost nothing (with the exception of functional work-related non-fiction books and the occasional self-help book), I made it my goal to read 23 books in 2023.
(PERSON8) I tried it, I think with two tokens, and yes, because in the first version we suspected that the token itself could also be tokenized, I repeated it using a different token that was not solely for this purpose, since we used a pre-trained dictionary, and this dictionary did not include separators. So, I used a token that I assumed would not be broken down into multiple parts, and thus it would only occur once. I had no guarantee that this token could not appear in other places in the sentence and that this could be the only place it could appear. So, it could have been done more neatly, yes, that's right.

Confusing plot
It has a slimmer design form that fits better in the hand, there are no sharp edges to get caught on, and since the power cable is firmly attached, it is far less susceptible to damage than the original XB1 controller. The drawbacks are: 1) The vibration effect triggered during action gaming feels much weaker. 2) The directional joystick and buttons on the controller wear out very quickly. We are very rough with the controllers and tend to wear out 2-3 controllers per year. For us, this means we need to be selective and prudent with annual investments in controllers. The controller could be equipped with more robust springs; after a few months, the most frequently used buttons stop responding and the right joystick loses its centering, meaning map screens zoom in and characters run forward without touching the controls.
Very nice guitar, it's too bad the company doesn't know how to protect their product. It's impossible to get one that isn't damaged. We sent back 2 due to shipping damage and the third was also damaged. We've given up. They ship them in the soft thin case with a sheet of packing paper in a box. No padding at all.

Currently, we are using a MutationObserver hack. For performance reasons, we do not observe the entire document. We create a detached temporary parent element, install the MutationObserver there, and observe when it is detached and reattached elsewhere.
It turned out that it was assumed that the call to IDirect3D::CreateViewport() would return an IDirect3DViewport3 object that had additional methods appended at the end compared to an IDirect3DViewport object that I implemented.

Biologists from Minnesota rescue trapped black bear
As she further explained, there is method to a strategy that most people in Washington would consider madness: It's the best way to earn the trust of the press. They will know that we don't twist the truth like everyone else. The Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) will quickly become the only credible source of information in Washington about TARP. We will sometimes embarrass ourselves and reveal things that we - and others - could easily hide, but we will shock the press with our honesty. No one else does that, and soon we will have a built-in defense when we are attacked. No matter what they hear, the press will come to us first and believe us because we will prove to them that we are telling the truth. This may be the most important reason for Biden to stay the course of radical accountability: In every presidency, there are inevitably moments when it is crucial to have the trust of the public and the institutions that protect the civic interest. Moreover, important capital can be gained by admitting our mistakes, and there is an important distinction that Biden can draw with his political opponents. The president would do well to follow the old wisdom: Tell the truth - and shame the devil.
Forget me, okay. Ignore me, okay. It hurts, but you just have to be yourself.
Yes, because I think it's a method that's very easy to test, and it should always be tested in contrast to the two encoders, and I would expect that it's sometimes better and sometimes worse than the two-encoder setting, depending on the exact task, like for example what exactly the second thing is that you're encoding. So, maybe if you have two copies, two paraphrases of the same sentence, it's kind of confusing for the attention or whatever, I don't know. The behavior could also be different for the old sequence-to-sequence methods, compared to Transformer, so for RNN it behaved differently then. Maybe with Transformer, it is harder to train, so you might need to increase the number of warm-up steps or warm-up iterations.

#FalconGameBooks
I can only say good things about this gift bag set. I was able to wrap all my Christmas presents with the bags, wrapping paper, and tissue paper. The product is of great quality and the different size options make it easier to find the perfect choice for every gift! I wholeheartedly recommend it. The seller is extremely friendly and attentive. He contacted me after my purchase to ensure that I was satisfied with my product. 5 stars across the board.
(PERSON8) No, I haven't processed it yet. [PERSON1] said as soon as they have received the transcript, we'll take care of it together.
I quite like Akkoma, the software and the domain name I got for my instance. But somehow I have the feeling that I got off on the wrong foot with this instance, so to speak. And I never felt comfortable there. I will stay here a bit longer and think about whether I should migrate at all.
Be that as it may, since it applied here, to resolve it, I had to extend my viewport implementation to include the IDirect3DViewport3 methods so that the call to the new method was valid.
Intersexuality is even recognized by TERFs and similar groups because it is generally more physical and therefore more visible. Just as mental health is seen by many as less "real" than physical health, I believe that transidentity is merely intersexuality of the mind.
Biden Justice Department "does not want an armed citizenry"
Yes, so for the English with multiple accents. We are now putting together a technical solution with [PERSON14]. The current idea [PERSON14] is working on is creating new sentences with words spoken in other sentences, and that across different speakers. So it will really be sentences with multiple speakers, and that could also improve the robustness against the different accents of these speakers. Ah, so this is an initial experiment. And later we may do a bit more on the topic of multiple accents. These new sentences will actually try to solve two problems with one experiment. One problem is the implicit language model. So the ASR system needs to see the maximum amount of sentences. And we will create new sentences from the text-only language model by incorporating the sound component, so that the language model for the ASR improves and the robustness against different speakers also gets better. And in a talk yesterday, I heard another idea. It was during training. They left out time bands and frequency bands from the sound. So they trained with disturbed inputs, and that also improved the robustness of the system enormously.
To be honest, I have tried almost every "humane" trap on the market with very little success. It doesn't make me particularly happy to kill them, but I will not accept any comments on the ethics of killing mice.
(PERSON4) And I think only two or three sentences were formulated in a way that would be correct in a different context, so the translation was wrong. And then there were some cases where the translation was completely incorrect because the sentence was really wrong and that part was incomprehensible, but that only happened in one or two instances.
Your task: (PERSON11) This is important. Please write this here in the documentation program, this <unintelligible/> summary, because this is for [PERSON2]. And also [PERSON2], when you talk to [PERSON10], and possibly [PERSON5] as well. If we have this tool, we have to send the audio to multiple ASRs or multiple staff <unintelligible/>. We have to send the audio separately to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR and the Czech ASR, for example depending on the <other_noise/>. And also to this language identification employee and then we have to merge these outputs, and that's a tool we don't have yet. This is the multi-source tool that will observe the text outputs and also follow the timestamps and it would emit the output in three separate language channels by using either silence or the correct ASR. So we need a filter for the ASRs, so that the ASR is silent when it's the wrong language and it's the recognized text when it's the right language. I just came up with this kind of setup. Another setup would be that the same sound is sent to ASR and this language checker. This language checker is essentially part of the ASR and mutes the ASR when it's the wrong language. That's also an option. So we need to figure out which kind of language identification integration is best suited for our purposes. So please keep thinking about what our pipelines will look like. Ideally, I think, the least confusion would arise in administration and so on if our MT models were multilingual. If they supported different source languages and they would translate from each of these languages into English. They might just make a copy if English was given as input, so we would have multilingual ASRs at the beginning. Everything goes into English and then from English into all other languages. And later, if [PERSON12] had a multilingual ASR model, language identification wouldn't even be necessary anymore.

The eight-eyed Repnids seem to watch as you set the glider down on the red soil, but they don't move towards you; in fact, they remain motionless as you exit the glider and slowly approach them. The ground beneath your feet begins to shake and then wobble, as if in an earthquake, and you lose your footing, while the Repnids seem unimpressed. The rock beneath you suddenly gives way. Repnids have dug tunnels beneath the surface, and you plummet into a seething mass of hundreds of Repnid bodies in a cavern below. The end is quick, as several pairs of venomous fangs inject their deadly poison and the air of Dyskra contaminates your lungs. No one will ever know that you were the first human time traveler.
The more I read studies on biological sex, gender, and psychology, the more I find the statement "My biological sex is male, my gender identity is female" to be simplistic and inaccurate. It almost seems like conceding part of an argument to the TERFs (Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists). I believe that being transgender means being "biologically non-binary". My biological sex is non-binary, my gender identity is female.
Antonio Conte complained about the defense, and this player is currently having difficulties defending. He is facing very good players like Barnes and Maddison, but it is very disappointing. Although the goal was disallowed, Leicester restored the 4-1 lead through Barnes nine minutes before the end. Despite the win against Manchester City last week, Tottenham missed the chance to overtake Newcastle and climb to third place.
I've been toying with this idea for a while:

I asked the seller before buying if the color was too yellow and I was told it was like antique gold, darker. Not even close, the set looks VERY cheap. It is super glossy yellow with lots of cubic zirconias, even shinier. Looks great in the photo, but in real life I wouldn't even give it to a teenager to wear.
Nevertheless, unimaginable fear, terror and expulsion have left invisible scars of trauma.
The battery life of the one I bought from Amazon is terrible. I still can't believe Logitech discontinued this remote, nothing else even comes close in comparison. I love this Harmony remote, this is my fourth one. The dog chewed up the first one, my husband knelt on the screen of the second one, and the third one still works, but there's also an elbow print right in the middle of the touchscreen, also courtesy of my husband. I bought this one as a replacement and the screen is great, but the included battery holds a charge for maybe a few days. My original (third) one holds a charge for weeks and I use my remote for everything.

African immigrants, with 28,020 people, formed the third-largest immigrant group in Oslo. Europeans from countries not part of the United Kingdom, the EU, or the EEA were the fourth-largest group in Oslo, with 15,566 residents. From here, the sizes of the groups decrease significantly. For example, in the year 2022, there were approximately 7,000 citizens from South American countries, while there were slightly more than 3,000 nationals from North and Central America. Meanwhile, fewer than 700 people from Oceania lived in Oslo.
I bought these in February. Recently I tried to use them and unfortunately my Keurig machine gives me an error message every time that the capsule is not compatible with my machine. I have been using Donut Shop capsules in my machine since I first bought it and never had a problem. Upon closer inspection of the coffee capsule, I noticed that the code printed on the top of the capsule is not very legible, so I can only assume that I have a bad box. I bought a box of 72, which consists of 6 boxes with 12 in each. I even tried one from each of the 6 boxes and always get the same error message. I know it's not my machine because other capsules I try work fine. It's only with this delivery that I have this problem. Very disappointing as my return period has expired. UPDATE, I spoke to a customer representative who refunded my money. Thank you AMAZON for your wonderful customer service!
This week's prompt at Revelations is "Stay up all night". I've been mulling over this little piece in my mind for a few days now. It's definitely more romance than smut. Maybe I've read too many novels with impossible "meet-cutes," and this is the result, but I like it. Also, I will definitely experience the mile-high orgasm someday, maybe not with a stranger.
Everything I needed
Adriana Kuch, 14, was found dead in her home in Bayville on February 3, two days after the disturbing video of the attack at Central Regional High School was posted online. The video showed the girls pouring a drink in the teenager's face, then kicking her and dragging her through the school hallways. They pushed Adriana against red lockers that lined the hallways, and one of the girls in a pink shirt repeatedly hit her.
For now, I'm giving it 3 stars. I don't want to leave a bad review for the seller unless he deserves it, but this drone overheats very often. I'm not sure if I should contact the seller or DJI Tello themselves, but I'll probably try both just to see what they say. I like the drone, it's a cool little toy that flies better than some larger older drones, and this one feels less like a toy than some of my larger drones. However, it's the only drone I've ever had overheating issues with, and it actually ruins the fun of flying. For now, I'm assuming it's a manufacturing issue that they need to fix as soon as possible if they want their product to be successful. I really hope the seller didn't send me a used drone, as I paid for a new one. I give the seller credit for the delivery, as it arrived a day after purchase. I will update my review after contacting the seller and DJI Tello.
White nationalists, gun fetishists, far-right dictator supporters... therein lies the danger. Deport the white supremacists.
Later in life, Modrow served on the Council of Elders of the Left Party. "Hans was a profoundly sincere and combative socialist," tweeted Dietmar Bartsch, the chairman of the Left Party parliamentary group in the Bundestag. "Until his old age, he was an important advisor in our party, whose wisdom will be missed."
Yes, I think - wasn't it Dominik who did some experiments with Ivana? I think last year or the year before last for "double empty", where they took the context into account or concatenated the context with the input sentence and did a kind of document-level translation. But with this concatenation, it's not entirely clear whether it has the same effect as when we use multi-encoder settings.
"Great attention is being paid to the development of sports infrastructure. A clear proof of this is this athletics complex with over six thousand seats," the letter from the Kazakh President states. Kazakh athletes successfully compete in major international competitions and represent Kazakhstan. They are a role model for the younger generation and inspire the youth to great victories, Tokayev noted. He expressed confidence that hosting the Asian Championships in Astana will give a new impetus to the development of athletics in the country, and advocates for stronger cooperation with international organizations in this area.

(PERSON2) And my idea is that a user clicks on this microphone button and starts talking, and while the user is talking, it simultaneously sends the audio data in small chunks. Let's say 200 or even 100 milliseconds. The user puts it in a queue on the HTTP server that I will later process with (ASR). And the model will make an inference from that. And whenever it has a new piece of transcript, it will be sent back, and the user should get the partial transcript back. And it should be displayed immediately in the text field.
Yes, yes, it is actually very important to parallelize everything, both the processing of the systems and the evaluation of the Cell DF, because you will have to do this many times, there will be errors, you will need to be able to restart quickly.
(PERSON4) Yes, thanks.

Echidna with amethyst and magenta spines. He is of average height, has an average build, and is muscular. His tail is extremely thick. His hair is raspberry-colored, short and curly.

I've played around a bit with Flutter. To be honest, I would hate to build my business on technology from Google. On the other hand, Google is one of the few big players with real incentives to create a compelling cross-platform experience, and it shows.
Abe hides his grief and laughs quickly, while Tom is not afraid to cry but is less amused by crude humor. Jan will hurt you before she lets you see that she was hurt and laughs the most when everything is in chaos. Mio knows that grief is the constant companion of life.
I was disappointed when I received this item because the silver part that goes around the housing seemed to be made of some kind of cheap plastic. It wasn't so much the fact that it was made of plastic that disappointed me, but rather the fact that the plastic used made it look incredibly cheap. In my opinion, this detail ruined the entire appearance. I also didn't have confidence that it would withstand daily use, so I ended up returning it. I was disappointed because without this flaw it would have been a good deal. However, if you can look past this, then maybe it's just right for you. It was well packaged and arrived quickly.
I'm fed up with conservative parties and governments designating themselves as business-friendly. They are not, at least not in Alberta.
Tim Sherwood slams £44 million new signing Pedro Porro after miserable Tottenham debut
You land the glider with the nose up on the side of the scree slope and get out. The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching, but they make no move to approach you. In fact, they are motionless as you slowly walk towards them. You stop while still standing on the pile of crumbled rock and earth, and speak to them saying "I come in peace, as a friend." It seems as if they cannot hear you, let alone understand, as your universal translator receives no response. You decide to use your psychic awareness to make contact with them. It is difficult to understand their thoughts; they are frighteningly alien and your mind recoils from the contact. You decide it would be dangerous to make contact again, and return to your glider, but the experience has cleared your mind, which has been confused since you jumped into the future. Back in the Falcon's Wing, you find it fairly easy to calculate a course to Earth in the year 3034 AD. Note that you have used up another polybdenum rod when you jumped.
We use something like Hypercore for the text flow, but I'm not sure if that would work for this.
A recently graduated artist did not take criticism well tonight. Partly because the criticism was poorly delivered. But it's important not to find excuses for problems, but to simply fix them, especially in production when your supervisor needs changes. Especially considering the competition.
I bought these lamps to supplement the light my new vegetable seedlings were getting from the window. I love many of the features of these lights. Pros: First, they easily clip to my shelf and can be bent into many positions so I can make adjustments as my plants grow. The lights are cool to the touch and have not caused any damage even when touching the plants. I believe my vegetables have benefited from them. They are dimmable, but I only use the strongest setting. I have not utilized the timer as I prefer to turn them on and off myself. This feature could be useful in an office environment with houseplants or while on vacation. Cons: I do not think these lights are strong enough to be the primary light source for seedlings. They are small! If they burn out, I have to buy a whole new unit.
I want these companies that facilitate transactions to explain to their customers how they set their percentages. They won't talk about it with Bloomberg, but if Spotify has a good quarter, they will.

(PERSON1) Yes, I think he told us at the beginning of the semester, if we want an A, we'll get an A. You should submit it within the second deadline. That's pretty much the only thing he asked for. But he also told us that based on trends from previous years, many people don't do that. They find it easier to study for the exam. No, sorry, to study for the exam ...

Prime Minister Smailov expressed his special gratitude to the President of the Asian Athletics Association, Dahlan al-Hamad, for his support in preparing and holding the championships. The Asian Indoor Athletics Championships are being held for the first time on CIS territory. The tournament involves over 500 athletes from 31 countries who will compete in running, relay, long jump, high jump, triple jump, pole vault, shot put and multi-event competitions. The tournament will run until February 12. It was previously reported that Kazakh runner Caroline Chepkoech Kipkirui won gold in the women's 3,000m and Olga Safronova won silver in the women's 60m at the tournament.

Remote work offers many possibilities. It allows people to work in a comfortable space instead of stuffy, noisy offices. Remote work creates opportunities for anyone with an internet connection and a good workspace. Additionally, by working from home, people can avoid long commutes that take time away from their day and their families.
It's something I've never said before.

I was fortunate to spend six unforgettable months alongside Nicholas in 2011 and to support a series of projects. When we met over the weekend, I was delighted to hear about the progress, especially with the tree planting and support for the farmers. Thousands of trees were planted and the farmers were able to achieve higher crop yields through support with equipment purchases and training.
This is a very beautiful skirt. The lace pattern is elegant and soft. It doesn't wrinkle, even after being stuffed in plastic and a box, it was very smooth, that's really cool. This can easily be styled more casually or more elegantly and has a vintage feel due to the length and cut, which I really like. I think this could flatter anyone. I'm 1.65m tall and weigh 59kg and ordered the size S, so I would say if you feel like you're stuck between S and M, you should definitely go one size down.

(PERSON6) Yes, I may have only thought about what kind of data we are currently using for this, because if you look at [ORGANIZATION4]'s models on [ORGANIZATION5], for example, they are already pretty good at these things.
A 16-year-old boy was charged with murder in connection with the fatal shooting of two students at a Chicago high school in December, police announced Friday. The suspect was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder, Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown announced. "Currently, we do not have a clear motive for why a 16-year-old would shoot and kill other children," Brown said. The suspect's name was not released Friday due to his age, although Brown said he will have to answer for murder and attempted murder as an adult.
The numbers from Statistics Norway showed that foreigners were distributed across all city districts, as over 14,000 immigrants were registered in Søndre Nordstrand, the southernmost district of Oslo. Many immigrants also lived in sought-after areas, as Frogner was the district with the fifth-highest number of foreigners. After that, Stovner, Bjerke, Grorud, Østensjø and Sagene made up the rest of the top ten city districts in Oslo with the most residents from another country.

And that, even though I haven't slept as well here in the last two nights as I do at home and am a bit exhausted from #MECFS, simply because I'm in an unfamiliar environment where it's harder for me to manage my energy levels and I have to remember where things are.
The owner of the Russian Wagner Group, a private military company actively involved in the fighting in Ukraine, has predicted that the war could drag on for years. Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video interview released late Friday that it could take 18 months to two years for Russia to gain full control of Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland of the Donbas. He added that the war could last three years if Moscow decides to capture larger areas east of the Dnieper River.
And I think we could probably just get the data from them, because they basically have such a large amount of videos with different areas and different native languages on [ORGANIZATION5]. And I had the idea that we could just use some tool to basically download some kind of filtered videos from [ORGANIZATION5] and make a training dataset out of that.
I am now on book no. 31 and it's only May.
Thank you to those who have downloaded the latest update for Leasey. A few minor issues have occurred. Nothing to set the alarm bells ringing, but, nevertheless, they will be fixed. Next week, a small update will be created to correct these. We spent most of yesterday installing the new update for some customers, and anyone who needs this support should have received it by now. Have a nice day!

But this is not universally true; for these cases, it is important which interface you use to create the object in question.

GAZIANTEP.KAZINFORM – Kazakh rescue teams continue to search for survivors in the rubble in Turkey, Kazinform reports, with reference to the press service of the Kazakh Ministry of Emergency Situations. The work of the rescue personnel is made difficult by large amounts of debris and unstable structures. So far, the Kazakh rescue team in Turkey has recovered seven earthquake survivors and the bodies of 19 people, including a small child. First medical aid is also provided around the clock. It is worth mentioning that an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7, which devastated parts of southeastern Turkey and northern Syria, struck early Monday. As of today, the death toll from the massive earthquakes in southeastern Turkey has risen to over 20,000.
In our everyday lives, we are constantly looking for ways to increase our energy and avoid burnout, especially at our jobs. This can be extremely difficult for people in healthcare, which is why I asked 30 health and wellness experts the same question: "How do you manage your energy and avoid burnout in your profession?" Their careers range from infectious disease specialists to psychologists to mindfulness teachers - and they all had great advice on how to stay motivated and keep the ball rolling. Despite the big differences in their roles, there were several themes in their responses that emerged as ways to avoid burnout.
Russia suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in the fall as the Ukrainian army launched successful counteroffensives to recapture large areas in the east and south. The Kremlin has refrained from making predictions about how long the fighting might last, stating that what it calls a "special military operation" would continue until its goals were achieved. Russian forces have focused on the Ukrainian oblasts of Luhansk and Donetsk, which make up the Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian troops since 2014.
A few months ago, I had bleached my entire hair and then dyed it over with a black coloration from the store. After that, I had highlights put in everywhere. A few weeks later, I dyed my hair with Arctic Fox hair color in blue/green, which wouldn't wash out. I used Olaplex No. 3 with it and it significantly lightened my hair, removed the green and blue areas, and also lifted the dark box color. However, after one day I noticed a greenish tint in my hair. It gets worse every day and I've already used the color correction treatment twice, with the same result. My hair is also getting darker where the box color was. This is a great product, but it doesn't seem to last long.
One person was arrested during a protest outside Tate Britain, where a drag queen storytime event for children was taking place. The Metropolitan Police said one person was arrested on suspicion of making a racially aggravated comment to a police officer outside the art gallery near Westminster. No injuries were reported and officers remain at the scene, the Metropolitan Police said.

And I agree that there is a lot of noise in this dictionary. So I asked that you create different versions of this dictionary by only taking the words that were observed five times. And only the pronunciations that were observed three times or more, or something like that. This way, these random errors, like the example with this "four IBM" error instead of "IBM", will not occur as frequently. But you will still have the pronunciation variants, because if the person says this "alzo" when you remember, if he says this "alzo" with a "Z" 20 times in the conversation, then you will see that in the data with the "Z". And if he sometimes manages to say it correctly, then you will also see that in the data. So I want [PERSON4] to stay in touch with [PERSON2]. Maybe you stay in the conversation, right? I have to go now because I have to make lunch for the kids and so on. But please stay in this conversation and figure out together how to use this dictionary. [PERSON4], so show [PERSON2] which dictionary the system accepts. Share your screen and show it. And [PERSON2], please look at that and help convert the dictionary you output into this file. What is still needed is the language model replacement. But all these words should be known words. [PERSON4], so you need to figure out which words are included in the language model. And the words that are included in the language model should just be copied. So the dictionary will have three columns. The grapheme as it is output. The phonemes as [PERSON2] suggested. And there will be multiple lines with different phoneme variations. And the third column will also be the same for all of these again, and again the same grapheme form will be there. This is what it looks like when the language model sees it. And I think this way these systems should be able to load it. And you may also run into another problem: that it's not ready for two large custom dictionaries. So that's also something that needs to be tested, but please test it together. [PERSON2] knows what he created in the dictionary. And you know what the dictionary looks like when you create it manually, and you need to put these two pieces of knowledge together so that it works with the generated dictionary.

Every artist has been there before and made the same mistakes. Good criticism is there to quickly correct the problem and is not directed against your ability. It assumes that you are capable of solving the problem or finding a solution.
(PERSON2) <unintelligible/>, that you like can improve your quality score by simply adding the output of the phrase-based system, and the attention is like a double diagonal, so I believe you, but it's surprising that it didn't work.

3 1/2 stars - Remedy is a mix of a love story between a brother's best friend and a second chance. It's a unique story where the hero (Grady) has to do everything to win Collins back and prove he's the one for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had a wonderful night together. Collins thought she would finally get everything she dreamed of, her brother's best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning and never heard from him again, things definitely changed. Now Grady is back, he's not leaving, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left and that he won't give up on her this time. While I loved the premise of this story and Grady at times, he really irritated me. I totally understand his reasons for leaving that night, but not even sending a letter to Collins to explain? Leaving her pondering and hurt all those years and then expecting her to welcome him back with open arms? Was he out of his mind?! Collins had every right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She was right to fight him when he wanted her back and wanted to move on. I admire her willpower because Grady was persistent. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong and protected her heart, and I admired her for that. Of course she loved Grady, but she was scared and hesitant to let him back into her life. Who wouldn't be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite of the two. She let things happen at exactly the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There is a lot of angst in this book, and I enjoyed watching these two come back together as Collins began to forgive Grady. I just wished Grady didn't come across as so whiny and was a little more understanding. He kept saying he understood, but sometimes he was a little too pushy for my liking, and then he was sweet towards the end. By the end, I loved him as much as Collins did, but at the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his point of view because I couldn't connect with his character. The first part of this book was not my favorite, but the second part? I loved that, which explains my rating. If you like second chance and brother's best friend romances, you might really enjoy this book. I just had a hard time with Grady in the beginning and how he handled some of the things he did.
But did I love it? Absolutely!
Derry City emerged victorious in the President's Cup by defeating Shamrock Rovers 2-0. The FAI Cup winners beat last season's champions at the Brandywell thanks to goals from Will Patching and Michael Duffy in the first half. The Hoops pushed for a goal in the second half, but Ruaidhri Higgins' team held firm and won the opener. Derry travel to St. Patrick's Athletic for the league opener next Friday. Patching's volley put Derry ahead after 23 minutes - the midfielder scored the first goal when the Foylesiders won 2-1 against the eventual champions in February.
There was great dissatisfaction that Leigh Drennan, the chair of Labour North West and assistant to Jeremy Corbyn-supporting MP for Warrington North, Charlotte Nichols, was not nominated as a potential candidate to win back the seat from the Conservatives, despite receiving nominations from four major unions. Reeves said she had nothing to do with the selection of candidates, but added: "I know it's really important that we have rigorous processes for who can be longlisted and shortlisted."
In recent years, some Hindu hardliners have stormed shops selling Valentine's Day items, burned cards and gifts, and chased hand-holding couples out of restaurants and parks, insisting that the day violates traditional values and promotes promiscuity. Hindu nationalist groups like Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal have stated that such raids help assert a Hindu identity. Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi say his government has pushed a Hindu agenda and seeks the supremacy of the religion in a secular nation known for its diversity. While Hindus make up nearly 80% of the nearly 1.4 billion people, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains account for much of the rest.
The hatred for literature class is even worse: I love to read. I had already finished most of the classics before I turned eighteen – although that was more because I lived in the deepest province, in my desperation I even read the 1979 Encyclopedia Britannica.

In July 2022, California officials charged Kilcher with two counts of workers' compensation fraud. She was accused of illegally receiving more than $96,000 in disability benefits between October 2019 and September 2021. The period also includes several months during which Kilcher worked on "Yellowstone," although the actress claimed to be too injured to work. Kilcher turned herself in to authorities and was arraigned before a judge in May.

Avoid Wi-Fi connection - go with Bluetooth! I bought this scale in October 2017 for my wife. At that time, we were in the middle of a move and living in a hotel. I couldn't connect the scale to the hotel's Wi-Fi. I decided to wait until we moved into our house and I could set up my own Wi-Fi system. March 2018 - I set up my Wi-Fi system and the scale still won't connect. Every time I try, I get an error message. Even when I'm only 10 feet away from the Wi-Fi device. I followed the instructions in the YouTube video, but to no avail. When I bought the device, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wi-Fi router to communicate with the phone. This system is limited to connecting to the router... which is usually not near the bedroom, unlike a phone! I would not recommend this scale to anyone due to the Wi-Fi connection. Instead, look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I will be replacing this with a Bluetooth connected scale.
(PERSON1), and then we'll find out which packages we will install in the Petri environment.
Waziri explained that these two tombs belonged to important people who lived at the beginning of the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom - one of the most important eras of ancient Egypt. He said that the tombs are T-shaped in design, a style frequently used in tombs from the 18th Dynasty. They consisted of an entrance, a columned hall leading to a burial shaft, and the walls with characteristic inscriptions. Waziri added that during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut, Djehuty served as the overseer of the state treasury and supervised the work of artisans and artists.

The circumstances surrounding O'Mara were "quite extraordinary", Reeves said, but she admitted: "There are important lessons that the Labour Party and all political parties need to learn when it comes to selecting candidates. But I would also say that in this parliament we have seen the constant undermining of standards in politics, not least through a succession of prime ministers and fines and parties and standards that fall far short of what one would expect." She added: "One more thing I want to say about the Labour Party: When people do wrong, they lose their membership in the parliamentary group. And that's simply not the case with the Conservative Party."
(PERSON6) So this is an important thing that we should have addressed months ago. Remember that I've been telling you since August that we want to evaluate on a later test dataset. And every time, all of you thought... It's not just about you personally, [PERSON8]. Of course, there were other things too. But every time you considered it, you assumed "this will be easy, we'll just run it". And only when you actually do it, you see all the problems. This is known, this is normal. It's always like that. So this is a message to everyone. Before you try it, you never know what the problem will be. For example, when I had the conversation where someone was interviewing me, they wanted to record the video. Zoom has never worked so badly for me as it did today during the recording. Before you do it, you can't say whether it will work or not. And here we are running into the problems of converting the file formats. Hopefully we will be able to get the numbers quickly. Do you already have any word error rate?
I discovered the hard way that in 2023, local TV station websites are the absolute worst experience on the internet. Pop-ups, auto-playing videos, animations, pop-ups, and ads, ads, ads. I know advertising is their revenue source, but all the junk seems counterproductive if it drives people away. This still holds true now, even though goatse.cx no longer exists, although it would be a close race to the bottom between goatse and, for example, khou.com, where I tried to watch a video Wendy sent me.
(PERSON3) I think it's actually an interesting question whether we can use the constraints to force the gender of the speaker in the translation.
Jami handed him the note as they passed each other in the hallway, shortly before the graveyard shift. She was heading to the wall, he had just finished his duty. He glanced behind him to watch her and to ensure they hadn't been spotted. She didn't look back. He waited until he was in the darkness of the sleeping quarters before pulling out the note and reading it in a beam of light that penetrated the blackout curtains. A single word written in block letters. He stared at it for a long time to maintain his composure:
One of the fans sounded unbalanced from the start. The speed controls are really unreliable -- if you set them to 100%, the fans turn off, so you have to turn to 100% and then slowly turn back until they kick on again. Build quality is mediocre, but that seems normal for most products of this type in this price range. The feet for propping the laptop up at an angle have broken off a couple of times... They snap back in, but it happens often enough to be annoying. On the positive side, the fan placement is ideal for laptops that pull air in from vents near the top of the laptop. Many other coolers have fans in the middle and provide very little additional airflow with such a cooling configuration.
Yes, if I have a short context, because I'm making decisions based on a very short context for this very low latency, then it really commits to something that, for example, it figures out in a second or two, oh, well, actually that was a bad translation. So it tries to use a different phrasing to specify the thing, for example. I really liked it. I liked some of the translations. I was really amazed, even though you could see the model made mistakes on the first try, it really wanted to make some kind of correction. And it definitely sounded really fluent, which I think is important too. If you really demand low latency, then I think even a slightly lower quality is okay if the fluency is good. Because if you have poor translation quality and poor fluency, then I think the translation is just pointless. But if the lower quality is due to the translation, when you read everything, you get the same information, but the phrasing is just poor because, for example, it used more words and used some corrections and so on. So, I think this is totally fine for simultaneous translation, as long as you don't lose any information. And for which language pairs do you have these results? Could you provide some examples? Because I'd love to look at it, just out of curiosity.

It's strange to do weightlifting but not really have a clue what your one-rep max is, because that's one of the main ways people track their progress. I work out alone in my bedroom without a spotter or even a rack. Just me and a barbell with a bunch of weights. I do bench presses on my bed. If I try to find my one-rep max, I might not own enough weights to push myself to the limit, or conversely it could seriously injure/kill me. Anyway, the load is being increased today. Still feels good.
Out of curiosity, I kept an open mind to compare how Google Maps and Apple Maps perform on my iPhone, which I use for testing purposes (my daily device is an Android device, so I rarely use an iPhone).

The incident occurred after an increase in the number of refugees and asylum seekers crossing the English Channel to Great Britain in boats. Police have arrested 15 people after an anti-refugee demonstration outside a hotel used to house asylum seekers turned violent near the English city of Liverpool. Merseyside Police said one police officer and two civilians were slightly injured in the riots on Friday evening in Knowsley. Police said some demonstrators threw objects and set a police car on fire. Those arrested, aged 13 to 54, were taken into custody "following violent disorder." Merseyside Police Commissioner Emily Spurrell told Radio City: "It was incredibly dangerous and there were a few injuries among the police officers."
