Your case: Source: Because for Interspeech, we could also split it up by paper. So that some papers would go into the Interspeech proceedings. And some of our submission papers would later come for the PBML proceedings. And the authors would be free to choose. So we have to negotiate this either with SIGDial or Interspeech. If it’s okay for them to have some of our papers, provided these papers are submitted by the March deadline. So there is an absolutely strict requirement. And I think they can’t have anything against it. Because if the paper is worth being published. It’s just a bonus that the paper has some results of the shared task in the satellite event. So yes, I think it’s okay. So we don’t have to apply for a special session. At Interspeech, it’s called a special session, which we don’t want. At Interspeech, we want the satellite event. But we will tell our people. If you manage to have your paper ready by the Interspeech deadline, submit it as an Interspeech paper and you will have it within Interspeech. Ah, if you don’t, ah, do it for the Interspeech deadline, here is our deadline. And that is for PBML.

Your case: According to a report by Bloomberg on Friday, Donald Trump's heavily indebted skyscraper at 40 Wall Street is under "lender watch" due to declining revenues and rising costs. The vacancy rate in the 72-story building - Trump's most valuable - rose to nearly 18% in the third quarter of last year, according to a monthly report on the remaining $126.5 million mortgage, Bloomberg reported. Expenses have reportedly increased by 11% since the mortgage was originated in 2015. Trump has often boasted about the building, which he acquired in 1995 and was valued at $540 million in 2015.
Your case: Source: Loved the ring - but couldn't wear it all the time! :( This ring was beautiful. I loved the design and the chunky feel; it looked expensive and was very comfortable! The only reason I gave it only 3 stars and ultimately returned the product is that I realized I couldn't wear it all the time. I like to wear my rings all the time, which is why I always make sure to buy sterling silver, and I know some people have said their rings tarnished after a while, but I had worn mine continuously for about a week - even while washing my hands - and noticed no tarnishing. Interestingly, the problem I had was that the inner band of the ring actually made my finger white and moist - similar to a bandage worn for a long time. This happened even when I made sure the ring and my finger were completely dry. I don't know why this happened and it hasn't happened with any other ring, but it became uncomfortable, so I decided it wasn't the right ring for me. :( It's a shame because I really loved it! However, if you buy this ring with the intention of wearing it only occasionally, I say: Go for it! You won't be disappointed!
Oh yes, only I don't know if you, if you, if you <unintelligible/> noticed when we talked about [PERSON1], but one thing is that the (blow) is better, but the other thing is that the lemmas are actually manually inflected correctly, but that's, that's another, no, not a problem, it's actually good, that's <unintelligible/> right, yes. So, I thought it might be. But I'm not sure if we have some test data for it, but we could try to play around with the models with some kind of style transfer? As you know, we can use a constraint and try to use a synonymous constraint instead and see or compare what the difference between the outputs is. But that's, like, I'm just vaguely describing it because I don't have an exact idea myself how to do it, but it might have been an interesting, different scenario. I don't know, [PERSON1], do you know about any style transfer data for English-Czech? Do we have anything?

At the other end of the spectrum, only 184 foreign residents called Marka their home, and slightly more than 700 lived in the central city district. Ullern, Vestre Aker, and Nordstrand formed the other districts with the fewest foreign residents. However, these districts had significantly more immigrants than central Oslo and Marka. People from EU and EEA countries, as well as from the United Kingdom, mainly lived in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo, and St. Hanshaugen. While many citizens from Asia, including Turkey, also lived in Gamle Oslo (5,837), most were registered in the districts of Alna, Stovner, and Søndre Nordstrand.

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources came to the aid of a very unfortunate bear after it was trapped in a ditch. The bear had settled in a culvert next to the road near Wannaska, Minnesota, according to a Facebook post by the department. But as the snow began to melt, the culvert started to flood, and the bear was trapped in deep snow and ice, according to the department. Department staff quickly responded to the scene and helped free the bear. The department's bear biologist, Andrew Tri, "examined the bear and declared it healthy but groggy - obviously because it had been awakened from its hibernation," according to the Facebook post. The department then took the bear to a state sanctuary to continue its hibernation. The sleepy carnivore was estimated to be 6 years old and between 375 and 400 pounds.

I'm sorry, what? My friend recommended the mask from this line to me, so I bought it, this conditioner, and the all-in-one milk. I can't say anything about the effectiveness of the product because the smell was simply unbearable. Do you know that musty smell that old buildings use in women's restrooms to cover up the smell of *ladies*, but it just comes out as this sour, chemical, somehow musty grandma smell? Yes, that's all I can think of when I smell it. Different people, different tastes, so maybe you'll like the smell. My friend said it could help even the most damaged hair, so if you don't care about the scent, then no worries. I know natural products don't smell as nice as some synthetic ones, but I feel like more and more natural lines care less about it since it sells anyway, and now everything just smells like Play-Doh. I've lost a few favorite lines because they switched the formula to cheaper ingredients. I don't know if that's the case here or if it's a fake (I called Davines and they said it wasn't), but this smells like Y U C K and I had to return it.
Your case: The news that Special Counsel Jack Smith has subpoenaed Mike Pence raises the question: How will Team Trump use the courts to obstruct this latest development in the Justice Department's investigation? The short answer is that any attempt to thwart Pence's subpoena on grounds of executive privilege should fail. First, there is the fundamental question of whether a former president can even claim the privilege. Remember that Trump tried to prevent the January 6 House Committee from obtaining White House documents and failed.

The graves of Djehuty and Hery were inaugurated on Thursday after the completion of restoration work. The inauguration was conducted by the Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Egypt, Mostafa Waziri, the Spanish Ambassador to Egypt, Alvaro Iranzo, and the President of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Eloísa del Pino. Waziri stated that the two graves were discovered by the joint Egyptian-Spanish archaeological mission of the Supreme Council of Antiquities and the CSIC, which has been active since 2002. He said that the mission carried out excavation and restoration work and published research on the graves located in the Dra Abu al-Naga area on the west bank of Luxor. They managed to uncover many graves, coffins, mummies, and a burial garden.

They still have the same segmentation issues and so on. But their mission in translation is shortening, simply because the data becomes shorter. And that's because their target size is the subtitles created for the hearing impaired. So, there is a natural shortening in the data. It would be great if we could also find such a type of data where a natural shortening occurs. We would incorporate it into the architecture.

Your case: Source: (PERSON8) I tried, I guess two tokens, and yes, because in the first version we suspected that the token could also be tokenized itself, I then repeated it with another token that is not used solely for this purpose, because we used a pre-trained dictionary, and this dictionary did not contain delimiters. So I used a token that I assumed would not be tokenized into multiple parts and therefore would only appear once. I had no guarantee that this token could not appear elsewhere in the sentence and that this would be the only place it could appear. So it could be done more neatly, yes, I agree with that.

Your case: Source: Confusing plot
Your case: Source: It has a slimmer design that fits better in the hand, there are no sharp corners to catch on, and with the power cable as a fixed component, it is much less prone to damage than the original XB1 controller. The disadvantages are: 1) The vibration effect triggered in action games feels much weaker. 2) The directional joystick and the controller buttons wear out very quickly. We are very rough and tend to wear out 2-3 controllers per year. For us, the annual investment in controllers means we have to be selective and careful about what we buy. The controller could use more robust springs; after a few months, the most frequently used buttons no longer respond, and the right joystick loses its centering, i.e., map screens zoom in and characters move forward without touching the controls.

Your case: Source: As she further explained, there is a method in a strategy that most people inside the Beltway would consider madness: This is the best way to gain the trust of the press. They will know that we don’t spin like everyone else. SIGTARP is quickly becoming the only credible source of information in Washington about TARP. We might sometimes embarrass ourselves and disclose things that we—and others—could easily hide, but we will shock the press with our honesty. No one else does this, and soon we will have a built-in defense when we are attacked. No matter what they hear, the press will come to us first and believe us because we will prove to them that we are telling the truth. This may be the biggest reason for Biden to pursue the course of radical accountability: In every presidency, there are inevitably moments when the trust of the public and the institutions that uphold the civic interest is crucial. Moreover, there is important capital to be gained by admitting our mistakes, and Biden can draw an important distinction from his political opponents. The president would do well to follow the old saying: Tell the truth—and shame the devil.

Your case: Source: (PERSON1) Yes, because I think it's a method that is very easy to test, and it should always be tested in contrast to the two encoders. I would expect it to sometimes be better and sometimes worse than the two encoder setups, depending on the exact task, like what exactly the second thing is that you're encoding. Maybe if you have two copies, two paraphrases of the same sentence, it's kind of confusing for the attention, so whatever, I don't know. The behavior might also be different for the old sequence-to-sequence methods compared to the transformer, so for RNN it might have behaved differently, maybe it's harder to train with the transformer, so you might need to increase whatever the number of warm-ups, warm-up sets.

Yes, so for the multilingual English. We [PERSON14] are now working on bringing this together into a technical solution. The current idea that [PERSON14] is working on is to create new sentences with words that were spoken in other sentences, and this across different speakers. This way, they become truly multi-speaker sentences, and thus the robustness against the various accents of these speakers could also be improved. Ah, this is a particle experiment. And later we could do more regarding the multilingual topic. These new sentences will actually try to solve two problems with one experiment. One problem is the implicit language model. The ASR system needs to see the largest possible amount of sentences. And we will create new sentences from the text-based language model by adding the sound part, so that the language model for the ASR becomes better and the robustness against different speakers also becomes better. And in a lecture yesterday, I heard another idea. It was during training. They left out time bands and frequency bands from the sound. So they trained with disturbed inputs, and that also significantly improved the robustness of the system.

Your case: Source: (PERSON4) And I think only two or three sentences were correctly inflected in the wrong context, as if the translation was wrong. And then there are some cases where the translation was completely wrong because the sentence was really wrong, and the part must be <unintelligible/>, but those were only one or two cases.
Your case: Source: (PERSON11) This is important. Please write this here in the documenter, this <unintelligible/> summary, because it is for [PERSON2]. And also [PERSON2], when you speak with [PERSON10], well and possibly also [PERSON5]. When we have this tool, we need to send the audio to multiple ASRs or multiple workers <unintelligible/>. We need to send the audio separately to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR, and the Czech ASR, depending on <other_noise/>. And also to this language ID worker and then we need to merge these outputs, and that is a tool we do not have yet. This is the multi-source tool that observes the text outputs and also follows the timestamps and it would - it would probably output in three separate language channels, either with silence or the correct ASR. So we need a filter for the ASRs, so that the ASR is silent when it is the wrong language, and it is the recognized text when it is the right language. I just invented this kind of setup. Another setup would be that the same sound is sent to ASR and this language checker. This language checker is essentially a part of the ASR that mutes the ASR when it is the wrong language. That is also an option. So we need to figure out which type of language ID integration is best for our purposes. Please keep thinking about what our pipelines look like. Ideally, I think the least management chaos and so on would arise if our MT models were multilingual. If they support different output languages and translate from one of these languages into English. Possibly just make a copy if English was given as input, so that we would have multilingual multiple ASRs at the beginning. All go into English, and then from English into all languages. And later, if [PERSON12] had a multilingual ASR model, this language ID would not even be necessary.

The eight-eyed Repnids seem to watch as you land the glider on the red ground, but they do not move towards you; in fact, they remain motionless as you step out of the glider and slowly approach them.

The more I read studies about sex, gender, and psychology, the more the statement "My sex is male, my gender is female" seems too simplistic and inaccurate to me.

I am initially giving it 3 stars, as I don't want to leave the seller a bad review unless he deserves it, but this drone overheats significantly. I'm not sure whether to contact the seller or DJI Tello directly, but I'll probably try both just to see what they say. I like the drone, it's a cool little toy that flies better than some larger, older drones, and some of my larger drones feel more like a toy than this one. However, it's the only drone I've ever had overheating issues with, and it actually takes the fun out of flying. For now, I assume it's a manufacturing issue that they need to fix as soon as possible if they want their product to be successful. I really hope the seller didn't send me a used drone, as I paid for a new one. I give the seller credit for the delivery, as it arrived a day after purchase. I will update my review after contacting the seller and DJI Tello.

You land the glider nose-up on the side of the slag mountain and get out. The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching, but they do not move towards you; in fact, they are motionless as you slowly approach them. You stop while still on the pile of crumbled rock and earth and speak to them: "I come in peace, as a friend." It seems they cannot hear you, let alone understand, as your universal translator receives no response. You decide to use your psychic awareness to make mental contact. It is difficult to understand their thoughts; they are terrifyingly alien, and your mind recoils from the contact. You decide it would be dangerous to attempt contact again and return to your glider, but the experience has cleared your mind, which had been confused since your leap into the future.

I bought this lamp to supplement the light my new vegetable seedlings get from the window. I love many of the features of these lights. Advantages: First, they are easy to attach to my shelf and can be bent into many positions, allowing me to make adjustments as my plants grow. The lights are cool to the touch and have caused no damage, even when they touch the plants. I believe my vegetables have benefited from the lights. The lights are dimmable, but I only use the strongest setting. I haven't used the timer, as I prefer to turn them on and off myself. I can see this feature being useful in an office with houseplants or on vacation. Disadvantages: I don't think these lights are strong enough to be the primary light source for young plants. The lights are small! If the lights burn out, I have to buy a whole new unit.

A 16-year-old boy was charged with murder in the fatal shooting of two students at a high school in Chicago in December, police said Friday. The suspect is charged with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder, Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown announced. "We currently have no clear motive as to why a 16-year-old would want to shoot and kill other children," Brown said. The suspect's name was not released on Friday due to his age, although Brown said he would be charged as an adult for the murder and attempted murder charges.

In our daily lives, we are constantly looking for ways to boost our energy and avoid burnout, especially in our profession.

Despite the vast differences in their roles, there were several themes in their responses that stood out as ways to avoid burnout.

The Kremlin has avoided making predictions about how long the fighting might last, stating that the so-called "special military operation" will continue until its goals are achieved. The Russian forces are focusing on the Ukrainian provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk, which form the Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014.

Your case: Source: And then I agree that there is a lot of noise in this dictionary. So I asked you to create different versions of this dictionary by only taking the words that were observed five times. And only the pronunciations that were observed three times or more, or something like that. This way, these random errors, like the example with this four IBM instead of IBM, won't occur as often. But still, you will have the variations in pronunciation, because if the person, let's say, says this "alzo," if you remember, if he says this "alzo" with a "Z" 20 times in conversation, then you will see that in the data with the "Z." And if he sometimes manages to say it correctly, then yes, you will see that again in the data. So I want [PERSON4] to stay in contact with [PERSON2]. Maybe stay in conversation, right? I have to go now because I have to give the kids lunch and so on. But please stay in this conversation and figure out together how you can use this dictionary. So [PERSON4], please show [PERSON2] which dictionary the system accepts. Share your screen and show it. And [PERSON2], please take a look at it and help convert the dictionary you created into this file. One thing that is still needed is the replacement of the language model. But all these words should be known words. So [PERSON4], you need to find out which words are in the language model. And the words that are in the language model should simply be copied. The dictionary will have three columns. The grapheme, as it is output. A recognized one. The phonemes, as [PERSON2] suggested. And there will be multiple lines with different phoneme variations. And the third column will also be the same for everyone, and again it will be the same grapheme form. That's how the language model sees it. And I think that this way these systems should be able to load it. And you may encounter another problem: that it is not ready for two large custom dictionaries. So that also needs to be tested, but please test it, both of you together. So [PERSON2] knows what he created in the dictionary. And you know what the dictionary looks like when you create it manually, and you need to combine these two pieces of knowledge. Ah, so that it works with the generated dictionary.

Your review: Source: 3 1/2 stars Remedy is a "brother's best friend" romance as well as a second chance romance in one. It is a unique story, and the hero (Grady) must do everything to win Collins back and prove that he is the right one for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an incredible night together. Collins thought she would finally get everything she had dreamed of, her brother's best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning and never heard from him again, everything definitely changed. Now Grady is back, and he's not going away, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left and that he won't give up on her this time. While I loved the premise of this story and sometimes liked Grady, he really got on my nerves. I understand his reasons for leaving that night, but not even sending a letter to Collins to explain himself? Leaving her in the dark and hurt for years and then expecting her to take him back with open arms? Was he insane?! Collins had every right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She had every right to resist him when he wanted her back and to move on. I admire her willpower because Grady was persistent. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong and protected her heart, and I admired her for that. Sure, she loved Grady, but she was afraid and hesitant to let him back into her life, who wouldn't be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite of the two. She definitely let things happen at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There is a lot of tension in this book, and I enjoyed watching the two reconnect as Collins began to forgive Grady. I just wish Grady hadn't come across as so whiny and had been a bit more understanding. He always said he understood, but sometimes he was a bit too pushy for me, and then he was sweet towards the end. In the end, I loved him just as much as Collins, but at the beginning of the book, I found it hard to read his perspectives because I couldn't connect with his character. The first part of this book wasn't my favorite, but the second part? I loved it, hence my rating. If you like second chances and "brother's best friend" romances, you might really enjoy this book, I just initially struggled with Grady and how he handled some things.
But did I love it? Absolutely!
Derry City emerged victorious in the President's Cup, winning 2-0 against Shamrock Rovers. The FAI Cup holders defeated last year's league winners at Brandywell thanks to first-half goals from Will Patching and Michael Duffy. The Hoops pushed for a reduction in the second half, but Ruaidhri Higgins' team held firm to win the opener. Derry travels to St. Patrick's Athletic next Friday for the league start. Patching's inside volley put Derry ahead after 23 minutes - the midfielder opened the scoring when the Foylesiders won 2-1 against the eventual champions last February.

In recent years, certain Hindu hardliners have raided businesses selling Valentine's Day items, burned cards and gifts, and driven hand-holding couples out of restaurants and parks, claiming the day violates traditional values and promotes promiscuity. Hindu nationalist groups like Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal have stated that such raids would help restore a Hindu identity. Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi say his government has pushed a Hindu agenda and seeks the dominance of the religion in a secular nation known for its diversity. While Hindus make up almost 80% of the nearly 1.4 billion people, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Jains constitute the majority of the remaining population.

Avoid the Wi-Fi connection - go for Bluetooth! I bought this for my wife in October 2017. At that time, we were in the middle of moving and living in a hotel. I couldn't connect this scale to the hotel's Wi-Fi. I decided to wait until we moved into our house and I could set up my own Wi-Fi system. March 2018 - I set up my Wi-Fi system and this scale still doesn't connect. Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I'm 3 meters away from the Wi-Fi device. I followed the YouTube setup video without success. When I bought the device, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wi-Fi router to communicate with the phone. This system is limited to the router connection... which is usually not near the bedroom, unlike a mobile phone! I would not recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wi-Fi connection. Please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication instead. I am replacing this with a scale that has a Bluetooth connection.

The circumstances of O'Mara were "quite extraordinary," said Reeves, but she admitted: "There are important lessons that the Labour Party and all political parties must learn when selecting candidates. But I would also say that in this Parliament we have seen the constant undermining of standards in politics, not least by a series of prime ministers and fines and parties and standards that fall far short of what one might expect." She added: "One thing I would say about the Labour Party is that when people do something wrong, they lose the party whip. And that is simply not the case in the Conservative Party."
Your case: Source: (PERSON6) So, this is an important matter that we should have discovered months ago. Remember, since August I've been telling you that we want to evaluate on a later test set. And every time, all of you... It's not just you personally, [PERSON8]. There were obviously other things as well. But every time you thought about it, you thought: "This will be easy, we'll just run it." And only when you actually do it, you see all the problems. That's known, common. It's always like that. So this is a message for everyone. Before you try, you never know what the problem will be. For example, the conversation I had where someone interviewed me, they wanted to record the video. Zoom has never worked so poorly for me as it did today during the recording. So, before you do it, you can't say whether it will work or not. And here we encounter the problems of converting file formats. Hopefully, we can get the numbers quickly. Have you had any word error rates so far?

He stared at it for a long time, trying to stay calm:
Your case: One of the fans sounded unbalanced from the start. The speed controllers are really unreliable – if you set them to 100%, the fans turn off, so you have to turn them to 100% and then slowly turn them back until they come on again. The build quality is mediocre, but that seems to be normal for most products of this type in this price range. The feet that hold the laptop in an inclined position have broken off a few times... They can be reinserted, but it happens often enough to be annoying. On the positive side, the fans are ideally placed for laptops that draw air through vents near the top of the laptop. Many other coolers have fans in the middle and provide very little additional airflow for a laptop with such a cooling configuration.
Yes, if it has a short context and because I make decisions based on a very short context for this very low latency, then it really commits to something that, for example, finds out in one or two seconds, oh, that was actually a bad translation. So it tries to use a different phrasing. For example, to specify the matter. So, I really liked it. I liked some of the translations. I was really amazed, although you could see that the model made mistakes on its first attempt, it really wanted to make some kind of correction. And it definitely sounded very fluent, which I also consider important. If you really demand low latency, then I think even slightly lower quality is fine if the fluency is good. Because if you have poor translation quality and poor fluency, then I think the translation is just pointless. But if the lower quality is due to the translation, when you read everything, delivering the same information, but the phrasing is just bad because it used more words, for example, and some corrections and so on. So I think this is completely fine for simultaneous translations as long as you don't lose any information. And for which language pairs do you have these results, like some examples? Because I would like to take a look, just out of curiosity.
