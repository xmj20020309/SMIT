Because for Interspeech, we could also divide it paper by paper. So that some papers would go into the Interspeech proceedings. And some of our submitted papers would later come for the PBML proceedings. And the authors would be free to choose. So we either have to negotiate this with SIGDial or Interspeech. If it's okay for them to have some of our papers, provided those papers are submitted by the March deadline. So there's an absolutely strict requirement. And I think they can't object to that. Because if the paper is worth publishing. It's just a bonus that the paper contains some results of a shared task that appear at the satellite event. So yes, I think it's okay. So we don't have to ask for a special session. At Interspeech it's called a special session, we don't want that. At Interspeech, we want the satellite event. But we'll tell our people: If you manage to get your paper ready by the Interspeech deadline, send it as an Interspeech paper and you'll have it within Interspeech. Ah, if you don't make it for the Interspeech deadline, here's our deadline. And that's for PBML.

Your case: Source: Donald Trump's heavily indebted skyscraper at 40 Wall Street is under "lender scrutiny" due to falling revenue and rising costs, according to a Bloomberg report on Friday. The vacancy rate in the 72-story building - Trump's most valuable - rose to nearly 18% in the third quarter of last year, according to a monthly report on the building's remaining $126.5 million mortgage, Bloomberg reported. Expenses have reportedly risen 11% since the mortgage was taken out in 2015. Trump has often boasted about the building, which he acquired in 1995 and which was valued at $540 million in 2015.

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources came to the aid of a very unfortunate bear after it was trapped in a ditch. The bear had settled in a culvert next to the road near Wannaska, Minnesota, according to a Facebook post by the agency. But as the snow began to melt, the culvert started to flood, and the bear was trapped in deep snow and ice, according to the agency. Agency staff quickly responded to the situation and helped free the bear. The agency's bear biologist, Andrew Tri, "examined the bear and declared it healthy but groggy - obviously because it had been awakened from its hibernation," according to the Facebook post. The agency then took the bear to a state sanctuary so it could continue its hibernation. The sleepy carnivore was estimated to be 6 years old and between 375 and 400 pounds.

I'm sorry, what? My friend recommended the mask from this line to me, so I bought it, this conditioner, and the all-in-one milk.

Do you know that musty smell that old buildings use in women's restrooms to cover up the smell of *ladies*, but it just comes out as this sour, chemical, somehow musty grandma smell? Yes, that's all I can think of when I smell it. Different people, different tastes, so maybe you'll like the smell. My friend said it could help even the most damaged hair, so if you don't care about the scent, then no worries. I know natural products don't smell as nice as some synthetic ones, but I feel like more and more natural lines care less about it since it sells anyway, and now everything just smells like playdough. I've lost a few favorite lines because they switched the formula to cheaper ingredients. I don't know if that's the case here or if it's a fake (I called Davines and they said it's not), but this smells like Y U C K and I had to return it.

(PERSON8) I tried it, I think with two tokens and yes, because in the first version we had the suspicion that the token itself could also be tokenized, so I repeated it with another token that is not just for this purpose, because we used a pre-trained dictionary, and this dictionary did not contain punctuation tokens. Therefore, I used a token that I assumed would not be tokenized into multiple parts and thus would only occur once. I had no guarantee that this token could not appear elsewhere in the sentence and that this is the only place it could appear. So it could have been done cleaner, yes, I agree with that.

It has a sleeker design form that fits better in the hands, there are no sharp corners to get caught on, and since the power cable is firmly attached, it is far less susceptible to damage than the original XB1 controller. The drawbacks are: 1) The vibration effect triggered in action games feels much weaker. 2) The directional joystick and controller buttons wear out very quickly. We are very clumsy and tend to wear out 2-3 controllers per year. For us, an annual investment in controllers means we have to be choosy and prudent about what we buy. The controller could be equipped with more robust springs; after a few months, the most frequently used buttons no longer respond and the right joystick loses its centering, i.e. map screens zoom and characters run forward without even touching the controls.

Your case: Source: Your case: Source: (PERSON17) Yes, so for the multi-accent English. So, we [PERSON14] are now putting this together into a technical solution. The current idea that [PERSON14] is working on is that he creates new sentences with words that have been spoken in other sentences, and he will do this across different speakers. So they will really be multi-speaker sentences, and this could also improve the robustness to the different accents of these speakers. Ah, so this is a particle experiment. And later we might be able to do something more on the topic of multi-accent. So these new sentences will actually try to solve two problems with one experiment. One problem is the implicit language model. So the ASR system needs to see the largest possible set of sentences. And we will create new sentences from the pure text language model by adding the sound part, so that the language model is better suited for ASR and the robustness to different speakers is also better. And in a talk yesterday I heard another idea. It was during training. They left out time bands and frequency bands from the sound. So they trained on disturbed inputs, and this also significantly improved the robustness of the system.

Your case: Source: ## Translation: Your case: Source: (PERSON11) This is important. Please write this summary here in the documentation tool, because this is for [PERSON2]. And also [PERSON2], when you talk to [PERSON10], and possibly also to [PERSON5]. If we have this tool, we need to send the audio to multiple ASRs or multiple workers <unintelligible>. We need to send the audio separately to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR and the Czech ASR, for example depending on <other noise>. And also to this language ID worker, and then we need to merge these outputs, and that's a tool we don't have yet. This is the multi-source tool that watches the text outputs and also tracks the timestamps and the - it would probably output the output in three separate language channels, to use either silence or the correct ASR. So we need a filter for the ASRs, so that the ASR is silent when it is the wrong language, and the recognized text when it is the correct language. I just came up with this kind of setup. Another setup would be that the same sound is sent to the ASR and this language checker. This language checker is essentially part of the ASR that mutes the ASR when it is the wrong language. That is also an option. So we need to figure out which type of language ID integration is best suited for our purposes. So please keep thinking about what our pipelines look like. Ideally, I think the least confusion would be caused in management and so on if our MT models were multilingual. If they supported different source languages and translated from each of these languages into English. They might only create a copy if English was given as input, so that we would have several multilingual ASRs at the beginning. All would go to English, and then would be translated from English into all languages. And later, when [PERSON12] had a multilingual ASR model, this language ID wouldn't even be needed.

I absolutely LOVE this Harmony remote, this is my fourth one. The dog chewed up the first one, my husband knelt on the screen of the second one, and the third one still works but there's an elbow mark in the middle of the touchscreen, also thanks to my husband... I bought this as a replacement, and the screen is great, but the battery it came with lasts maybe a couple of days. My original (the third) holds a charge for weeks, and I use my remote for everything.

Your case: Source: I bought these in February. Recently I tried to use them and unfortunately every time I try one I get an error message from my Keurig machine that the pod is not compatible with my machine. I have been using Donut Shop pods in my machine since I first bought it and have never had a problem. Upon closer inspection of the coffee pod, I noticed that the code printed on the top of the pod is not very legible, so I can only assume I got a bad box. I bought a 72 count box, which is 6 boxes of 12. I have even tried one from each of the 6 boxes and I keep getting the same error message. I know it is not my machine because other pods I try work fine. It is only from this shipment that I am having this issue. Very disappointing as my return window has expired.

I like the drone, it's a cool little toy that flies better than some bigger, older drones, and some of my bigger drones feel more like a toy than this one. However, it's the only drone I've ever had with overheating problems, and that takes the fun out of flying it. I'm assuming for now that it's a manufacturing defect that they need to fix ASAP if they want their product to be successful.

You stop while still standing on the mound of crumbled rock and earth, and speak to them, saying: "I come in peace, as a friend." They don't seem to be able to hear you, let alone understand you, as your universal translator receives no response. You decide to use your Psychic Awareness to make mental contact with them.

The lights are cool to the touch and haven't caused any damage even when touching the plants. I believe my vegetables have benefited from the lights. The lights are dimmable, but I only use the strongest setting. I haven't used the timer as I prefer to turn them on and off myself.

The lights are small! If the lights burn out, I have to buy a whole new unit.

Your case: Source: And then I agree that there is a lot of noise in this dictionary. So I asked you to create different versions of this dictionary by only taking the words that were observed five times. And only the pronunciations that were observed three times or more, or something like that. This way, these random errors, like the example with this four IBM instead of IBM, will not be as frequent. But still, you will have the variations in pronunciation, because if the person, let's say, this "alzo", if you remember, if he says this "alzo" with a "Z" 20 times in the speech, then you will see that in the data with the "Z". And if he also manages to say it correctly sometimes, then of course you will also see that in the data. So, I would like [PERSON4] to get in touch with [PERSON2]. Maybe you can stay in touch, right? I have to go now because I have to take the kids to lunch and so on. But please stay in this conversation and figure out together how you can use this dictionary. So [PERSON4], please show [PERSON2] which dictionary the system accepts. Share your screen and show it. And [PERSON2], please take a look at it and help with the conversion of the dictionary that you have outputted into this file. One thing that is still needed is the replacement of the language model. But all these words should be familiar words. So [PERSON4], you need to find out which words are in the language model. And the words that are in the language model should simply be copied. So the dictionary will have three columns. The grapheme, as it is outputted. One recognized. The phonemes, as [PERSON2] suggested. And there will be several rows with different phoneme variations. And the third column will also be the same for all of these, and again it will be the same grapheme form. So that's when the language model sees it. And I think in this way these systems should be able to load it. And you may also encounter another problem: that it is not ready for two large custom dictionaries. So that is also something that needs to be tested, but please test it, both of you together. So [PERSON2] knows what he has created in the dictionary. And you know what the dictionary looks like when you create it manually, and you need to put these two pieces of knowledge together. Ah, so that it works with the generated dictionary.

This is even true now that goatse.cx is gone, although it would be a close race for last place between goatse and, say, khou.com, where I was trying to watch a video Wendy sent me.
I think this is actually an interesting question of whether we can use the limitations to enforce this kind of speaker gender in the translation.
Your case: Source: Jami slipped him the note as they crossed paths shortly before the dog watch. She was on her way to the wall, he was coming off duty. He glanced behind him to watch her and make sure they hadn't been seen. She didn't look back. He waited until he was in the darkness of the sleeping quarters before he pulled out the note and read it in a shaft of light that pierced through the blackout curtains. One word in block letters. He stared at it for a long time, trying to stay calm:
Your case: Source: One of the fans sounded uneven out of the box. The speed controllers are really shaky -- if you turn them to 100%, the fans turn off, so you have to turn them to 100% and then slowly turn them back down until they start again. The build quality is mediocre, but that seems to be the case with most products of this type in this price range. The feet that hold the laptop when it's tilted have broken off a few times... They can be put back in, but it happens often enough to be annoying. On the plus side, this cooler has ideal fan placement for laptops that draw air in through vents near the top of the laptop. Many other coolers have fans in the middle and offer very little additional airflow to a laptop with such a cooling configuration.
Yes, if it has a short context and because I make decisions based on a very short context for this very low latency, then it really commits to something that it finds out in one or two seconds, oh, well, that was actually a bad translation. So it tries to use a different wording. For example, to clarify the matter. So, actually I liked it very much. I like some of the translations. I was really amazed, although you could see that the model made mistakes on its first attempt, it really wanted to make some kind of correction. And it definitely sounded very fluent, which I think is also important. If you really demand low latency, then I think a slightly lower quality is also okay if the fluency is good. Because if you have bad translation quality and bad fluency, then I think the translation is simply pointless. But if the lower quality is because the translation, when you read everything, gets the same information, but the wording is simply bad, because it has used more words, for example, and has made some corrections and so on. So, I think that's perfectly fine for simultaneous translation, as long as you don't lose any information. And for which language pairs do you have these results, for example? Because I would like to take a look at it, just out of curiosity.

Your case: Source: It's strange to do weightlifting but at the same time have no real idea what your one-rep max is, as this is one of the main ways people track their progress. I train alone in my bedroom without a spotter or even a weight rack. Just me and a barbell with some weights. I press on my bed. When I try to do my one-rep max, I have to be very careful not to drop the weight on myself. I've been doing this for a few months now, and I've made some progress, but I'm still not sure what my one-rep max is. I'm thinking about getting a spotter or joining a gym so that I can finally figure it out. 
Your case: Source: Curious, I kept an open mind to compare how Google Maps and Apple Maps perform on my iPhone test device (my daily driver is an Android device, so I rarely use an iPhone). Target: Do not provide any explanations or text apart from the translation.
Your case: The UPS store near me does not allow me to write a label or write on the box. You have to print the label.

Your case: Source: The incident occurred after a rise in the number of refugees and asylum seekers crossing the English Channel to the UK in boats. Police have arrested 15 people after an anti-refugee demonstration turned violent outside a hotel housing asylum seekers near the English city of Liverpool. Merseyside Police said one officer and two civilians were slightly injured in the disturbances on Friday evening in Knowsley. Police said some protesters threw objects and set fire to a police van. Those arrested, aged between 13 and 54, were taken into custody "following violent disorder". Merseyside Police Commissioner Emily Spurrell told Radio City: "It was incredibly dangerous, and there were a couple of injuries to police officers."
