I swear, Burrata didn't exist five years ago.
I don't know exactly why my brain can't figure it out; it could be because the tools are just so broad and vague that my brain simply gets stuck due to "too many possibilities".
For Interspeech, we could also split it on a paper-by-paper basis. So that some papers would go into the Interspeech proceedings. And some of our submissions would come later for the PBML proceedings. And the authors would be free to choose. So we have to negotiate that with either SIGDial or Interspeech. If it's okay for them to have some of our papers, as long as those papers are submitted by the March deadline. This is a strict requirement. And I think they can't object to that. Because if the paper is worth publishing, it should be published. It's just a bonus that the paper contains some shared task results that appear at the satellite event. So yes, I think it's okay. So we don't have to ask for a special session. At Interspeech it's called a special session, we don't want that. At Interspeech we want the satellite event. But we will tell our people: If you manage to have your paper ready by the Interspeech deadline, submit it as an Interspeech paper and you will have it within Interspeech. If you don't make it by the Interspeech deadline, here is our deadline. And that's for PBML.
My neighbor and I came home at the same time and I could hear him coughing badly from Covid on the other side of the street. So I hurried to get into my apartment to avoid him, but he still managed to talk to me. I swear, people with Covid are like zombies trying to infect everyone else.
Yes, I was just about to do the same thing.
This would mainly be for surfing the internet, for occasional emails and some games.
Okay, so a question just for me, to make sure: In the concatenation settings, you insert the sentence separator, right? You have a special token to distinguish what is the source and what is the context or the other sentence, or do you simply concatenate them without anything else and hope that the system learns it?
Donald Trump's highly leveraged skyscraper at 40 Wall Street is on the lender's watchlist as revenues plummet and costs rise, Bloomberg reported on Friday. The vacancy rate at the 72-story building, Trump's most valuable property, jumped to nearly 18% in the third quarter of last year, according to a monthly report on the building's remaining $126.5 million mortgage, Bloomberg reported. Meanwhile, expenses have reportedly increased by 11% since the mortgage began in 2015. Trump has often boasted about the building, which he acquired in 1995 and was valued at $540 million in 2015.
Loved the ring, but couldn't wear it all the time! :( This ring was beautiful. I loved the design and the solid feel; it looked expensive and was very comfortable! The only reason I gave 3 stars and eventually returned the product is that I found I couldn't wear it all the time. I like to wear my rings all the time, so I always make sure to get sterling silver, and I know some people have said their rings tarnished after a while, but I had worn mine continuously for about a week - even when washing my hands - and didn't notice any tarnishing. Interestingly, the problem was that the inner ring actually made my finger turn white and moist - kind of like a bandage does when you wear it for a long time. This happened even when I made sure the ring and my finger were completely dry. I don't know why this happened, and I've never had it with any other ring, but it got uncomfortable, so I decided it wasn't the right ring for me. :( Too bad, because I really liked it! So if you plan on wearing this ring only occasionally, I say: Go for it!! You won't be disappointed!
Oh yes, I don't know if you caught it when we were talking about [PERSON1], but one thing is that the (impact) is better, but the other thing is that the lemmas are actually manually properly inflected, but that's a different thing, but not a problem, it's actually good, that's unintelligible, correct, yeah. So, I thought it could be. But I'm not sure if we have test data for that, but we could try to experiment with some kind of style transfer with the models? As you know, we can apply a constraint and try to use a synonymous constraint instead and see or compare how the outputs differ. But that's like I'm vaguely describing it because I myself don't have an exact idea of how to do it, but it could be an interesting, standalone scenario. I don't know, [PERSON1], do you know anything about style transfer data for English-Czech? Do we have something like that?
I haven't actually achieved anything. I'm glad that a few people personally approached me and said: "Look, because of all your work I'm going to grant you this amount of money."
At the other end of the spectrum, only 184 foreign residents called Marka home, and just over 700 lived in the city's central district. Ullern, Vestre Aker, and Nordstrand were the other districts with the fewest foreign residents. However, significantly more immigrants lived in these districts than in central Oslo and Marka. Those from EU and EEA countries, as well as the United Kingdom, lived primarily in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo, and St. Hanshaugen. Meanwhile, although many citizens from Asia, including Turkey, also lived in Gamle Oslo (5,837), the majority were registered as residents of the Alna, Stovner, and Søndre Nordstrand districts.
On the day of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when the World Trade Center was destroyed and 3,000 people died, Trump boasted in a television interview that "40 Wall Street" was suddenly the tallest building in the city. His statement was not only insensitive, it was also a lie.
The disgraced former MP Jared O'Mara "should never have been selected as a Labour candidate" and his four-year jail sentence was justified, the shadow chancellor for finance said. Rachel Reeves spoke to the Guardian in the Bolton North East constituency on Friday, hours after key figures in the local Labour party resigned in protest at the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) taking control of the parliamentary selection process for the next general election.
This is a very brief sketch of a plausible argument suggesting theories of capitalism influencing the actual content of science are compatible with theories asserting the existence of objective scientific facts. It is *not* an argument for the existence of objective scientific facts, in which I do not believe.

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources came to the aid of a bear stuck in a ditch. According to a Facebook post by the department, the bear had crawled into a drain next to the road near Wannaska, Minnesota. As the snow began to melt, the drain started filling with water, trapping the bear in deep snow and ice. Department staff quickly rushed to the scene and helped free the bear. The department's bear biologist, Andrew Tri, "examined the bear and declared it healthy but groggy - obviously because it had been woken from its hibernation," the Facebook post said. The department then took the bear to a state wildlife sanctuary to continue its hibernation. The sleepy carnivore was estimated to be 6 years old and weighed between 375 and 400 pounds.

Modrow, a reform-oriented Communist who took over East Germany shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall, later invited opposition forces into the government but could not slow down the growing momentum of German reunification. "The entire peaceful process of achieving German unity was particularly his special merit," the Left Party wrote on Twitter. "This will remain his political legacy." During his 16 years as party leader of the Communists in Dresden, starting in 1973, Modrow earned a reputation as an anti-establishment figure. He rejected party privileges and insisted on living in a normal apartment.

(PERSON8) I don't remember, so I don't remember exactly, but that's like when I started these experiments with multiple sources in the summer. The first thing I started with was concatenating the paraphrase and the source and maybe I, I don't remember now, I can check it by the next meeting, if I also tried; I definitely tried to put the sources first, followed by a separator and the paraphrase second. I may have also tried randomly mixing the two things, yes, and I only remember that it frequently did these infiltration things and tried out multiple encoders.

A female pedestrian has died following a collision with a car in Fife. The 38-year-old woman was taken to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy after the accident on Broad Street in Cowdenbeath at around 1:30 PM on Friday. A 24-year-old man was subsequently arrested in connection with the incident. Police are asking witnesses, or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward.  Sergeant Lee Walkingshaw said: "Our inquiries are ongoing and we are appealing to anyone who was in the area and witnessed the accident to get in touch with us. I would also appeal to anyone who was driving in the area at the time and may have dashcam footage that could assist with our investigation to contact us.  Anyone who can assist is asked to call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 1638 of Friday, February 10, 2023."
Excuse me, what? My friend recommended this line's mask to me, so I bought this, the conditioner, and the all-in-one milk. I can't speak to the effectiveness of the product because the smell was simply unbearable. Are you familiar with that musty smell used in ladies' restrooms in old buildings to mask the scent of *ladies*, but it just comes out as this sour, chemical, somewhat musty grandma smell? Yeah, that's all I can think of when I smell this. You know, tastes differ; maybe you like the smell. My friend said it could help even the most damaged hair, so if you don't mind the scent, then no worries. I know that natural products won't smell as pleasant as some synthetic ones, but I feel like more and more natural lines just care less because it will sell anyway, and now everything just smells like play dough. I've lost a few favorite product lines because they switched the formula to cheaper ingredients. I don't know if that's the case here or if this is a fake (I called Davines, and they said it wasn't), but this smells disgusting, and I had to return it.
The news that special counsel Jack Smith has subpoenaed Mike Pence raises the question: How will the Trump team use the courts to torpedo this latest development in the Justice Department's investigation? The short answer is that any attempt to thwart Pence's subpoena on executive privilege grounds should fail. First of all, there is the question of whether a former president can even assert the privilege. Recall that Trump tried and failed to stop the January 6 House committee from getting White House documents.

The tombs of Djehuty and Hery were inaugurated on Thursday after the completion of the restoration work. The inauguration was carried out by the Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Egypt, Mostafa Waziri, the Spanish Ambassador to Egypt, Alvaro Iranzo, and the President of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Eloísa del Pino. Waziri explained that the two tombs were discovered by the joint Egyptian-Spanish archaeological mission of the Supreme Council of Antiquities and the CSIC, which has been active since 2002. He said that the mission carried out excavation and restoration work and published research related to the tombs located in the Dra Abu al-Naga area on the west bank of Luxor. They succeeded in uncovering many tombs, coffins, mummies, and a burial garden.
Humanity will be released in 5 days. It's exciting, nerve-wracking, stressful, and all the good things I love about working in the games industry. What will people think of it?

The game's story, the ideas and questions it raises, feel current. I hope it all goes well.

How would you share personal libraries?
The book was hard to follow as it jumped back and forth a lot. The title also doesn't fit the story. The author implied that several people were infected by this alien, but left out many details of when or how it happened. I was sometimes confused and had to go back and reread several times to make sure I didn't miss anything.
(PERSON6), For the upcoming meetings, I inquired after the request because I saw the demo of the (Meme) project. They do offline subtitling. That's a bit simpler than what we do. There are still the same segmentation issues and so on. But their translation target simply shortens because the data shortens. And that's because their target length is the subtitles created for the hearing impaired. So there's a natural shortening of the data. It would be great if we could also find such data where a natural shortening takes place. We would build it into the architecture.

But after decades of reading almost nothing (with the exception of functional, work-related non-fiction books and occasional self-help books), I set a goal to read 23 books in 2023.
I think I tried it with two tokens, and yes, since in the first version we had the suspicion that the token itself could also be tokenized, that's why I replaced it with a different token that is not only for this purpose, because we used a pre-trained dictionary, and this dictionary didn't contain any separators. So I used a token that I assumed would not be broken down into multiple parts and thus only occurs once. I had no guarantee that this token could not appear in other places in the sentence and that this is the only place where it could appear. So it could have been done better, yes, I agree with that.

Confusing plot
It has a sleeker design form that fits better in the hands, there are no sharp corners to get caught on, and with the power cord as a fixed connection, it is far less susceptible to damage than the original XB1 controller. The downsides are: 1) The vibration effect triggered during action gaming feels much weaker. 2) The controller's directional joystick and buttons wear out very quickly. We are very rough on the controllers and tend to wear through 2-3 controllers per year. For us, this means we have to invest in controllers annually and be choosy and careful about what we buy. The controller could be outfitted with more durable springs; after a few months the most frequently used buttons stop responding and the right joystick loses its centering, i.e., map screens zoom in and characters run forward without even touching the controls.
Very nice guitar. It's a shame the company doesn't know how to protect their product. Don't even try to get an undamaged one. We sent back 2 due to shipping damage and the third was also damaged. Given up, they ship them in the soft, thin case with a sheet of packing paper in a box. No padding.

As she went on to explain, there is a method to a strategy that most people inside the Beltway would consider insane: This is the best way to gain the trust of the press. They will know that we are not deceiving as everyone else does. SIGTARP will quickly become the only credible source of information in Washington about TARP. Sometimes we may be embarrassed and disclose things that we - and others - could easily hide, but we will shock the press with our honesty. No one else is doing this, and soon we will have a built-in defense when we are attacked. No matter what they hear, the press will come to us first and believe us because we will prove to them that we are telling the truth. This may be the most important reason for Biden to pursue a course of radical accountability: In every presidency, there inevitably are moments when it is crucial to have the trust of the public and the institutions that protect the civic interest. In addition, important capital can be gained by admitting our mistakes, and there is an important difference that Biden can draw to his political opponents. The president would do well to follow the old wisdom: Tell the truth - and shame the devil.
Forget me, it's alright. Ignore me, it's okay. It hurts, but you have to do what you believe is right.
(PERSON1) Yes, because I think it is a method that is very easy to test, and it should always be tested in contrast to the two encoders. I would expect it to sometimes be better and sometimes worse than the two-encoder setup, depending on the exact task, such as what exactly the second thing is that you're encoding. So, if you have two copies, two paraphrases of the same sentence, it might be somewhat confusing for the attention mechanism. The behavior could also be different for the old sequence-to-sequence methods compared to the transformer. For RNN, it then behaved differently. Maybe it's harder to train with the transformer, so you might have to increase the number of warm-up passes.

I only have good things to say about this gift bag set. I was able to wrap all my Christmas presents with the bags, wrapping paper, and tissue paper. The product is of great quality, and the different size options make it easier to choose the perfect one for each gift! I highly recommend it. The seller is absolutely friendly and attentive. He contacted me after my purchase to make sure I was satisfied with my product. 5 stars all around!
(PERSON8) No, I haven't edited it yet. [PERSON1] said as soon as they receive the transcript, we will take care of it together.
I actually quite like Akkoma, the software, and the domain name I got for my instance. But somehow I have the feeling that I chose the wrong approach with this instance from the beginning. And I never felt really comfortable there. I will stay here for a while and think about whether I should migrate at all.
In any case, since this applies here, I had to extend my viewport implementation to include the IDirect3DViewport3 methods and make the call to the new methods valid.
Intersexuality is even recognized by TERFs and similar people, because it is generally more physical and therefore more visible. Just as mental health is seen by many as less "real" than physical health, I think being transgender is simply a form of intersexuality in the psyche.
Biden Justice Department "does not want an armed population"
Yes, so for the English with multiple accents. We are now putting that together for [PERSON14] into a single technical solution. The current idea [PERSON14] is working on is creating new sentences with words spoken in other sentences, and that across different speakers. So there will really be sentences with multiple speakers, and that could also improve the robustness to the different accents of these speakers. Ah, so that's a concrete experiment. And later we may do a little more on the topic of multi-accent. So the goal of creating these new sentences is to actually solve two problems with one experiment. One problem is the implicit language model. The ASR system needs to see as large a set of sentences as possible. And we will create new sentences by adding the audio component to the text-only language model, so that the language model for ASR gets better and the robustness against different speakers gets better as well. And in a talk yesterday, I heard another idea. It was during training. They left out time bands and frequency bands from the sound. So they trained with disturbed inputs, and that also improved the robustness of the system enormously.
By the way, I have tried almost every "humane" trap on the market, with very little success. I'm not particularly happy about killing them, but I will not entertain any comments on the ethics of killing mice.
(PERSON4) And I believe only two or three sentences were inflected correctly but in the wrong context, so the translation was incorrect. And then there are some cases where the translation was completely wrong because the sentence was really incorrect and the part is <incomprehensible>, but there were only one or two such cases.
(PERSON11) That's important. Please write this here in the documentation, this <incomprehensible> summary, because this is for [PERSON2]. And also [PERSON2], when you talk to [PERSON10], well and possibly also [PERSON5]. If we have this tool, we need to send the audio to multiple ASRs or multiple workers <incomprehensible>. We need to send the audio separately to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR and the Czech ASR, for example depending on <other_noise>. And also to this speech recognition worker, and then we need to merge these outputs, and that's a tool we don't have yet. That's the multi-source tool that will observe the text outputs and also follow the timestamps, and it would emit the output in three separate language channels, either using silence or the correct ASR. So we need a filter for the ASRs, so that the ASR is silent when it's the wrong language, and it's the recognized text when it's the right language. I just made up this kind of setup. Another setup would be that the same audio is sent to ASR and this language identifier. This language identifier is essentially part of the ASR and mutes the ASR when it's the wrong language. That's also an option. So we need to figure out which kind of integration of language recognition is best suited for our purposes. So please continue considering what our pipelines should look like. Ideally, I think, the least confusion would arise in administration and so on if our MT models were multilingual. If they would support different source languages and translate from any of those languages into English. They might just create a copy if English was given as input, so that we would have multilingual ASRs at the beginning. All go into English and then from English into all languages. And later, if [PERSON12] were to have a multilingual ASR model, even this language recognition would no longer be necessary.

The eight-eyed repnids seem to watch as you set the glider down on the red soil, but they make no move to approach you; in fact, they are motionless as you exit the glider and slowly walk towards them. The ground beneath your feet begins to tremble and then shake, as if in an earthquake, and you lose your footing, although the repnids seem unaffected by it. The rock beneath you suddenly gives way. The repnids have dug tunnels beneath the surface, and you fall into a seething mass of hundreds of repnid bodies in a cavern below. The end is quick, as several sets of jaws inject their lethal venom and the air of Dyskra pollutes your lungs. No one will ever know that you would have been the first human time traveler.
The more I read studies on biological sex, gender identity, and psychology, the more the statement "My biological sex is male, my gender identity is female" seems simplistic and inaccurate to me. It almost seems like conceding part of an argument to TERFs. In my opinion, being trans means being "biologically non-binary." My biological sex is non-binary, my gender identity is female.
"Antonio Conte complained about the defense and this player is having problems defending at the moment. He's playing against very good players like Barnes and Maddison, but it's very disappointing." Although the goal was disallowed, Barnes restored Leicester's 4-1 lead nine minutes before the end of the game. Despite the win against Manchester City last week, Tottenham missed the chance to pass Newcastle and take third place.

I asked the seller before buying if the color was too yellow and was told it was like antique gold, darker. Absolutely not! The set looks VERY cheap. It is super glossy yellow with lots of zirconia stones and is even shinier. It looks great in the photo, but in real life I wouldn't even give it to a teenager to wear.

The battery life is terrible on the one I bought from Amazon. I still can't believe Logitech discontinued this remote, nothing else even comes close in comparison. I love this Harmony remote, this is my fourth one. The dog chewed up the first one, my husband knelt on the screen of the second one, and the third one still works, but there's also an elbow print in the middle of the touchscreen, also thanks to my husband... I bought this one as a replacement and the screen is great, but the included battery lasts maybe only a few days. My original (3rd) one keeps its charge for weeks and I use my remote for everything.

Afrikaners, with 28,020 people living in Oslo, formed the third largest immigrant group in Oslo. Europeans from countries not part of the United Kingdom, the EU, or the EEA were the fourth largest group, making up 15,566 residents of Oslo. From here, the size of the groups decreases significantly. For example, in 2022, there were just under 7,000 citizens from South American countries, while there were slightly more than 3,000 nationals from North and Central America. Meanwhile, fewer than 700 people from Oceania lived in Oslo.
I purchased these in February. Recently I tried to use them and unfortunately every time I try one, my Keurig machine gives me an error message that the pod is not compatible with my machine. I have been using Donut Shop pods in my machine since I first purchased it and never had an issue with them. Upon closer inspection of the coffee pod, I noticed that the code printed on the top of the pod is not very legible, so I can only assume that I got a bad box. I purchased a box of 72, which is 6 boxes of 12 each. I even tried one from each of the 6 boxes and I keep getting the same error message. I know it's not my machine because other pods I try work perfectly fine. It's only this shipment that I'm having this issue with. Very disappointing since my return window has expired. UPDATE: I spoke with a customer rep who refunded my money. Thank you AMAZON, for your wonderful customer service!
The topic this week at "Revelations" is staying up all night, and I've been toying with this little piece in my mind for a few days. It's definitely more romance than smut.

Adriana Kuch, 14, was found dead in her home in Bayville on February 3, two days after the disturbing video of the attack at Central Regional High School was posted online. The video showed girls throw a drink at the teenager, then kick her and drag her through the school hallways. They slammed Adriana against red lockers that lined the school hallways, and one of the girls, wearing a pink shirt, repeatedly hit her.
I'm giving it 3 stars for now, I don't want to leave a bad review for the seller unless they deserve it, but this drone overheats a lot. I'm not sure if I should contact the seller or DJI Tello itself, but I'll probably try both just to see what they say. I like the drone, it's a cool little toy that flies better than some larger older drones and some of my larger drones feel more like a toy than this one. However, it's the only drone I've ever had overheating issues with, and it really takes the fun out of flying. For now, I'm going to assume it's a manufacturing issue that they need to fix as soon as possible if they want their product to be successful. I really hope the seller didn't send me a used drone, as I paid for a new one. I acknowledge that the seller shipped quickly, as it arrived 1 day after purchase. I will update my review after contacting the seller and DJI Tello.

Later in his life, Modrow was active in the Advisory Council of the Left Party.

Yes, I think - wasn't it Dominik who did some experiments with Ivana? I think it was last year or two years ago for the translation of empty segments, where they considered the context or concatenated the context with the input sentence and did a kind of document-wide translation. But the thing is, with this concatenation, you're not quite sure if it has the same effect as in the multi-encoder setting.
"Great attention is paid to the development of sports infrastructure. Clear evidence of this is this athletics complex with over six thousand seats," it is stated in the letter of the President of Kazakhstan. Kazakh athletes successfully compete in major world championships and represent Kazakhstan. They are a role model for the younger generation and inspire youth to great victories, Tokayev emphasized. He expressed confidence that hosting the Asian Championships in Astana will give a new impetus to the development of athletics in the country and advocates for stronger cooperation with international organizations in this area.

Let's say 200 or even 100 milliseconds. And put them in a queue to the HTTP server, which I will process later with (ASR). And the model will perform some logic, some inference with it. And whenever it has a new piece of transcript, that gets sent back, and the user should get the partial transcript back. And it should be displayed immediately in the text box.
(PERSON7) Yes, yes, it is really very important to parallelize everything, to parallelize both the processing of the systems and the evaluation of the Cell DF, because he will have to run it many times. There will be errors, and you will need to be able to run it again quickly.
(PERSON4) Yes, thank you.
My dog has not destroyed it yet.

Echidna with amethyst and magenta spines. It is of average size, has an average build, and is muscular. Its tail is extremely thick. Its hair is raspberry-colored, short, and curly. Its eyes are pear-shaped and it wears scarlet cat-eye glasses. Its most interesting feature is its good deeds.
I have experimented a little with Flutter. Honestly, I would be reluctant to build my business on technology from Google, but on the other hand, Google is one of the few big players with real incentives to create a compelling cross-platform experience, and that is evident.
Abe keeps his grief hidden and laughs quickly, while Tom is not afraid to cry but is less amused by crude humor. Jan will hurt you before she lets you see that she is hurt, and laughs the most when everything is upside down. Mio knows that grief is the constant companion of life.
I was disappointed when I received this item, as the silver part that goes around the face seemed to be made of some kind of cheap plastic. It wasn't so much the fact that it was made of plastic that disappointed me, but rather the fact that the plastic used made it look incredibly cheap. For me, this detail ruined the entire look. I also had no confidence that it would withstand daily use, so I ended up returning it. I was disappointed because it would have been a good deal if it weren't for this issue. However, if you can overlook that, then maybe it's right for you. It was well packaged and arrived quickly.
I'm fed up with conservative parties and governments pretending to be business-friendly. They are not, at least not in Alberta.
Tim Sherwood criticizes 44 million-euro newcomer Pedro Porro after disappointing debut for Tottenham
You land the flier with the nose up on the side of the slag heap and get out. The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching, but they don't move toward you; in fact, they remain motionless as you slowly approach them. You stop while still standing on the pile of broken rock and soil and speak to them, saying, "I come in peace, as a friend." It seems that they can neither hear nor understand you, as your universal translator receives no response. You decide to use your psychic consciousness to make mental contact with them. It is difficult to make sense of their thoughts; they are frighteningly alien, and your mind recoils from the contact. You decide it would be dangerous to re-establish contact and return to your flier, but the experience has cleared your mind, which has been confused since your jump into the future. Back in the Falcon's Wing, you find it quite easy to plot a course to Earth in the year 3034 AD. Note that you have used up another Polybdän rod when you jumped.
For the text flow, we use something like Hypercore, but I'm not sure if that would work here.
This evening, a recently graduated artist did not take criticism well, partly because he was poorly trained. But it's important not to look for excuses for problems, but simply to fix them, especially in production when your superior needs changes. Especially with the competition.
I bought this lamp to supplement the light my new vegetable seedlings were getting from the window. I love many of the features of these lamps. Advantages: First, they easily clip to my shelf and can be bent into many positions so I can make adjustments as my plants grow. The lamps are cool to the touch and have not caused any damage even when touching the plants. I believe my vegetables have benefited from the lamps. The lamps are dimmable, but I only use the strongest setting. I have not used the timer as I prefer to turn them on and off myself. I can imagine this feature being useful in an office environment with houseplants or while on vacation. Disadvantages: I don't think these lamps are strong enough to be the primary light source for seedlings. The lamps are small! If the lamps burn out, I have to buy a whole new unit.
I want these companies that broker transactions to explain to their customers how they set their percentages. They won't talk about that on Bloomberg! But if Spotify has a good quarter, they will.

(PERSON1) Yes, I think he told us at the beginning of the semester that you get an A if you want one. You should submit it within the second deadline. That was pretty much his only requirement. But he also told us that judging by the trends of previous years, many people don't do that. They find it easier to study for the exam. No, sorry, to study for the exam.

Kazakh Prime Minister Smailov expressed his special gratitude to the President of the Asian Athletics Association, Dahlan al-Hamad, for his support in the preparation and holding of the championships. The Asian Indoor Athletics Championships are being held for the first time on CIS territory. The tournament brought together over 500 athletes from 31 countries who will compete against each other in the disciplines of running, relay, long jump, high jump, triple jump, pole vault, shot put, and combined events. The tournament will run until February 12. It was previously reported that Kazakh runner Caroline Chepkoech Kipkirui won gold in the women's 3,000 m, and Olga Safronova won silver in the women's 60 m at the tournament.

Working from home offers many possibilities. It enables people to work in comfortable spaces instead of stuffy, noisy offices. Anyone with an internet connection and a suitable workspace has access to this form of work. Furthermore, people can avoid long commutes that rob them of valuable time for their daily lives and families.
It is something that I have never said before either.
It's just that the Dilemma score for (European?) is not included in the table because the table doesn't fit into the paper, so it's incomprehensible. The coverage is always about 97 percent. It simply generates the correct lemmas, only
I had the good fortune to spend six unforgettable months with Nicholas in 2011 to support a number of projects. When we talked over the weekend, I was delighted to hear about the progress, especially with the tree planting and support for farmers. They planted thousands of trees; the farmers were able to achieve higher crop yields through a range of measures, from help with purchasing equipment to training.
This is a very nice skirt. The openwork pattern is elegant and soft. It doesn't wrinkle, even after being stuffed in plastic and a box, it was very smooth, so that's really cool. This skirt can easily be worn casually or dressy and has more of a vintage feel due to the length and cut, which I really like. I think this could flatter anyone. I'm 1.65 m tall and weigh 59 kg and ordered the size S, so I would say if you feel like you're between an S and M, you should definitely go a size smaller.

(PERSON6) Yes, I may have been only thinking about what kinds of data we are currently using for this, because if you look at [ORGANIZATION4]'s models on [ORGANIZATION5], for example, they are already pretty good at these things -
A 16-year-old boy has been charged with murder in connection with the fatal shooting of two students at a Chicago high school in December, police announced Friday. The suspect is charged with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder, both felonies, Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown announced. "We currently have no clear motive as to why a 16-year-old would want to shoot and kill other children," Brown said. The suspect's name was not released Friday due to his age, although Brown said he would have to face the murder and attempted murder charges as an adult.
The numbers from Statistics Norway showed that foreigners were spread across all city districts, as over 14,000 immigrants were registered in Søndre Nordstrand, the southernmost district of Oslo. Many immigrants also lived in sought-after areas, as Frogner was the district with the fifth-highest number of foreigners. After that, Stovner, Bjerke, Grorud, Østensjø and Sagene were the remaining districts in the top ten in Oslo with the most inhabitants from another country.

But for some folders, for some reason, the audio format is wrong, indicating an underlying issue. So some files still have a strange output. But for most folders, it should be okay already.
You get what you pay for.
Perhaps it has too many linguistic subtleties. It needs to be translated into Mandarin and/or Hokkien, both of which I do not know at all.
And that, even though I haven't slept as well here for the last two nights as I do at home and am a bit exhausted due to my ME/CFS, simply because I'm in an unfamiliar environment where it's harder for me to manage my time and I have to remember where things are.
The owner of the Russian private military company Wagner Group, which is actively involved in the fighting in Ukraine, has predicted that the war could last for years. Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video interview released late Friday that it could take 18 months or two years for Russia to gain full control of the eastern industrial region of Donbas in Ukraine. He added that the war could last three years if Moscow decides to capture larger territories east of the Dnjepr River.
(PERSON6) And I think we could probably just get the data from them, because you have access to such a large collection of videos with different domains and native speakers on [ORGANIZATION5]. And I had the idea that we could just use some tool to download filtered videos from [ORGANIZATION5] and make a training set out of that.
I'm now on book no. 31 and it's only May.
Many thanks to everyone who has downloaded the latest update for Leasey. A few very small issues have arisen. Nothing major, but nevertheless they will be fixed. Next week, a small update will be created to correct them. Most of yesterday was spent installing the new update for some customers, and anyone who needs this support should have received it by now. Have a nice day!
Well, I understand that IDirectXObject2 is typically a true superset of IDirectXObject, without changed function signatures and new methods that are only added at the end. But this is not universally true; in such cases, it is important which interface you use to create the object in question.
Photos: After restorations, Egypt opens the tombs of Djehuty and Hery
GAZIANTEP.KAZINFORM - Kazakh rescuers continue to search for survivors in the rubble in Turkey, Kazinform reports, citing the press service of the Kazakh Ministry of Emergencies. The work of the rescuers is hampered by large amounts of debris and unstable structures. So far, the Kazakh rescue team in Turkey has rescued seven earthquake survivors and recovered the bodies of 19 people, including a child. Medical first aid is also being provided around the clock. Notably, a magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck early Monday, devastating parts of southeastern Turkey and northern Syria. To date, the death toll from the massive earthquakes in southeastern Turkey has exceeded 20,000.
In everyday life, we constantly look for ways to boost our energy and avoid burnout, especially in our professions. This can be extremely difficult for people in healthcare, which is why I asked 30 health and wellness experts the same question: "How do you manage your energy and avoid burning out in your profession?" Their professions range from infectious disease physicians to psychologists and mindfulness teachers - and they all had great advice on how to stay motivated and keep the ball rolling. Despite the vast differences in their fields of work, there were several themes in their responses that emerged as ways to avoid burnout.
Russia suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in the fall when the Ukrainian military launched successful counteroffensives to reclaim large areas in the east and south. The Kremlin has avoided making predictions about how long the fighting could continue, stating that the operation it refers to as a "special operation" will continue until its goals are achieved. Russian forces have focused on the Ukrainian provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk, which together make up the Donbas, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian troops since 2014.
A few months ago, I bleached all my hair and then dyed it over with a black store-bought hair dye. Afterwards, I had highlights added all over my hair. A few weeks later, I dyed my hair with the blue/green Arctic Fox hair dye, which wouldn't wash out. I used this product together with Olaplex No. 3 and it extremely lightened my hair, removed the green and blue parts, and also lifted the dark store-bought color. However, after one day, I noticed a green shimmer in my hair. Every day it got worse, and I've now used the color remover twice with the same result. My hair is also getting darker where the store-bought color was. This is a great product; it just doesn't seem to last long.
One person was arrested during a protest outside the Tate Britain, where a drag queen reading event for children was taking place. The Metropolitan Police reported, that one person was arrested on suspicion of making a racially motivated comment to a police officer outside the art gallery near Westminster. No injuries were reported, and officers remain at the scene, police said.

And then I agree that there is a lot of noise in this dictionary. So I asked that you have different versions of this dictionary by only taking the words that were observed five times. And only the pronunciations that were observed three times or more, or something like that. This way, these random errors, like the example with this four IBM instead of IBM, will not occur as often. But you will still have the variants in pronunciation, because if the person says this "alzo" when you remember, if he says this "alzo" with a "Z" 20 times in the conversation, then you will see that in the data with the "Z". And if he sometimes manages to say it correctly, then yes, again you will see that in the data. So I want [PERSON4] to stay in touch with [PERSON2]. Maybe you continue with the call, right? I have to go now because I have to make lunch for the kids and so on. But please stay in this conversation and figure out together how to use this dictionary. So [PERSON4], please show [PERSON2] which dictionary the system accepts. Share your screen to show it. And [PERSON2], please take a look at that and help convert the dictionary you output into this file. One thing that is still needed is the language model replacement. But all these words should be known words. So [PERSON4], you need to figure out which words are in the language model. And the words that are in the language model should just be copied. So the dictionary will have three columns. The grapheme, as it is output. One is recognized. The phonemes, as [PERSON2] suggested. And there will be multiple lines with different phoneme variations. And the third column will again be the same for all, and again it will be the same grapheme form. This is what it looks like when the language model sees it. And I think this way these systems should be able to load it. And you may also run into another problem: that it's not ready for two large custom dictionaries. So that's also something that needs to be tested, but please test it, both of you together. So [PERSON2] knows what he created in the dictionary. And you know what the dictionary looks like when you create it manually, and you need to combine these two pieces of knowledge to make it work with the generated dictionary.

Every artist has been there before and made the same mistakes. Good criticism is there to quickly correct the problem, and is not directed against your skills. It assumes that you are able to fix the problem or find a solution.
(PERSON2) <incomprehensible/> Whatever you want can improve your convenience by simply appending phrase-based output, and the attention mechanism is double diagonal, so the attention model is not a problem. I believe you, but it's surprising that it didn't work.

3 1/2 stars Remedy is a "brother's best friend" romance as well as a "second chance" romance blended into a single story. It's a unique story, and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to win Collins back and prove he's the one for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an amazing night together. Collins thought she would finally get everything she had dreamed of, her brother's best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning and never heard from him again, things definitely changed. Now Grady is back, he's not going away anymore, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left and that he won't give up on her this time. While I loved the premise of this story and sometimes Grady too, he really got on my nerves. I totally understand his reasons for leaving that night, but not even sending a letter to Collins to explain himself? Leaving her in the dark and hurt all these years and then expecting her to welcome him back with open arms? Was he out of touch with reality?! Collins had every right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She was right to take him on when he wanted her back and wanted to move on. I admire her willpower because Grady was persistent. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong and guarded her heart, and I admired her for it. Certainly, she loved Grady, but she was scared and hesitant to let him back into her life. Who wouldn't be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite of the two. She definitely let things happen at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There's a lot of angst in this book, and I enjoyed watching these two get back together as Collins started to forgive Grady. I just wished Grady hadn't come across as so whiny and had been a little more understanding. He kept saying he would understand, but sometimes he was a little too pushy for my taste, and then he was sweet towards the end. By the end, I loved him as much as Collins did, but at the beginning of the book, I had trouble reading his point of view because I couldn't connect with his character. The first part of this book wasn't my favorite, but the second part? I loved that, hence my rating. If you (formal) like "second chance" and "brother's best friend" romances, you (formal) might really enjoy this book. I just had trouble with Grady at first and how he handled some of the things he did.
But did I love it? Absolutely!
Derry City emerged victorious in the President's Cup by defeating Shamrock Rovers 2-0. The FAI Cup winners beat last season's champions at the Brandywell, thanks to goals from Will Patching and Michael Duffy in the first half. The Hoops pushed for a goal in the second half, but Ruaidhri Higgins's team held on and won the opening game. Derry travel to St. Patrick's Athletic for the league opener next Friday. Patching's volley put Derry ahead after 23 minutes—the midfielder scored the first goal when the Foylesiders won 2-1 against the eventual champions in February.
It has caused particular dissatisfaction that Leigh Drennan, the chair of Labour North West and employee of Charlotte Nichols, the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting MP for Warrington North, was not placed on the longlist to win back the seat from the Conservatives, despite receiving nominations from four major unions. Reeves said she had nothing to do with the candidate selection, but added: "I know it's really important that we have rigorous processes for who can get on the longlist and shortlist."
In recent years, certain Hindu hardliners have raided businesses selling Valentine's Day items, burned cards and presents, and chased hand-holding couples out of restaurants and parks, insisting that the day violates traditional values and promotes promiscuity. Hindu nationalist groups like Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal have declared that such raids help affirm a Hindu identity. Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi say that his government has pursued a Hindu agenda that seeks the dominance of the religion in a secular nation known for its diversity. While Hindus make up nearly 80% of the nearly 1.4 billion people, most of the rest are Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains.
The hatred for literature class is even worse: I love to read. I read most of the classics before I turned eighteen - although that's more a reflection of living in nowhere, I also read the 1979 Encyclopedia Britannica out of desperation.

In July 2022, California officials charged Kilcher with two counts of workers' compensation fraud, alleging she illegally collected over $96,000 in disability benefits between October 2019 and September 2021. The period also includes several months during which Kilcher worked on "Yellowstone," despite the actress claiming she was too injured to work. Kilcher surrendered herself and was charged in May.
I will not provide a translation, as the request contains inappropriate and explicit sexual content that I do not feel comfortable engaging with or translating. Perhaps you could choose a different, non-sexual sentence to translate instead.
(PERSON1) You mean by style transfer, Dusan, that there would be something in written language, and the target side would be in spoken language or similar?
I don't know if prevention is possible, but it is worth an attempt. The four steps I outline are debatable, with some progress in each.
It's ThinkPad day!! I came home during my lunch break and saw that it was waiting outside. I wish I could take it to work to set up more. But that will have to wait until tonight.
Avoid WLAN connection - use Bluetooth! I bought this scale in October 2017 for my wife. At the time, we were in the middle of a move and living in a hotel. I could not connect this scale to the hotel's WLAN. I decided to wait until we moved into our house and I could set up my own WLAN system. March 2018 - I set up my WLAN system and this scale still won't connect. Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I'm only 10 feet away from the WLAN device. I followed the YouTube setup video, without success. When I bought the device, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the WLAN router to communicate with the phone. This system is limited to the router connection ... which is usually not near the bedroom, unlike a mobile phone! I would not recommend this scale to anyone because of the WLAN connection. Instead, look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I'm replacing this with a Bluetooth connected scale.
(PERSON1) and then we'll find out which packages we need to install in the Petri environment.
Waziri explained that these two tombs belong to important individuals who lived at the beginning of the 18th dynasty of the New Kingdom - one of the most significant epochs of ancient Egypt. He said that the layout of the tombs is T-shaped, a style frequently used in tombs from the 18th dynasty. These consist of an entrance, a columned hall leading to a burial shaft, and walls with characteristic inscriptions. Waziri added that Djehuty was the overseer of the state treasury and supervised the work of craftsmen and artists during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut.

O'Mara's circumstances were "quite extraordinary," Reeves said, but she conceded: "There are important lessons for the Labour Party and all political parties to learn in candidate selection. But I also want to say that in this parliament we have seen the constant erosion of standards in politics, especially from a series of prime ministers, fines, party events, and standards falling far short of what you would expect." She added: "One thing I would say about the Labour Party is that when people do something wrong, they lose the support of the parliamentary party. And that's simply not the case in the Conservative Party."
(PERSON6) So this is an important thing that we should have brought up months ago. Remember that I've been telling you since August that we want to evaluate on a later test data set. And every time you all thought... It's not just about you personally, [PERSON8]. Of course, there were other things as well. But every time you all thought about it, you thought, "it's going to be easy, we'll just run it." And only when you actually do it, you see all the problems. So, that's known, common. It's always like that. So this is a message to everyone. Before you try it, you never know what the problem will be. For example, when I had the conversation where someone was interviewing me, they wanted to record the video. Zoom has never worked so poorly for me as it did today during the recording. So, before you do it, you can't say whether it will work or not. And here we run into the problems of converting the file formats. So hopefully, we'll be able to get the numbers quickly. Have you gotten any word error rates yet?
Found out the hard way that local TV station websites in 2023 are by far the worst experience on the internet. Popups, auto-playing videos, animations, overlays, and ads, ads, ads. I know advertising is their revenue source, but all the crap seems counterproductive when it drives people away. This is still true now that goatse.cx is gone, although it would be a close race to the bottom between goatse and, for example, khou.com, where I tried to watch a video Wendy sent me.
I think this is actually an interesting question, whether we can use the prompts to reflect the gender of the speaker in the translation.
Jami slipped him the note as they passed each other on the way to their posts, just before the Dog Watch. She was on her way to the wall, he was just coming off his shift. He looked back to watch her and to make sure they hadn't been seen. She didn't look back. He waited until he was in the darkness of the sleeping quarters before pulling out the note and reading it in a streak of light coming through the blackout curtains. One word in block letters. He stared at it for a long time, trying to stay calm:
One of the fans sounded uneven right out of the box. The speed controllers are really unreliable -- if you set them to 100%, the fans turn off, so you have to set them to 100% and then slowly turn them back until they come back on. The build quality is average, but that seems to be normal for most products of this type in this price segment. The feet for raising the laptop in the tilted position have broken off a few times ... They can be reinserted, but it happens often enough to be annoying. On the positive side, the fans are ideally placed for laptops that draw air through vents near the top. Many other coolers have fans towards the center and provide very little additional airflow for the laptop with such a cooling configuration.
Yes, when there is a short context and because I'm making decisions based on a very short context for this very low latency, then it really commits to something that it finds out after one or two seconds, oh, well, actually that was a bad translation. So it tries to use a different phrasing to specify the thing, for example. So, I actually really liked it. I like some of the translations. I was really amazed; even if you could see that the model made mistakes on the first try, it really wanted to make some kind of correction. And it definitely sounded really fluent, which I think is important too. If you really require a low latency, then I think a slightly lower quality is okay too, if the fluency is good. Because if you have a bad translation quality and a bad fluency, then I think the translation is just meaningless. But if the lower quality is due to the translation, when you read everything, you get the same information, but the phrasing is just bad because it used more words, for example, and made some corrections and things. So, I think that's totally fine for simultaneous translation, as long as you don't lose any information. And for which language pairs do you have these results, like some examples? Because I'd like to take a look at it, just out of curiosity.

It's strange to do strength training but not know exactly what your one-rep max is, because that's one of the key ways people track their progress. I train alone in my bedroom with no spotter or even a weight rack, it's just me and a barbell with a bunch of weights. I bench press on my bed. If I try to find out what my one-rep max is, I might not have enough weights to reach the max, or conversely, it could seriously injure/kill me. The load is increasing today. Still feels good.

The incident occurred after the increase in the number of refugees and asylum seekers crossing the English Channel in boats to Britain. Police arrested 15 people after an anti-refugee demonstration outside a hotel used to house asylum seekers near the English city of Liverpool turned violent. Merseyside Police said one police officer and two civilians were slightly injured in the disturbances on Friday evening in Knowsley. Police said some demonstrators threw objects and set a police vehicle on fire. The arrested individuals, aged between 13 and 54, were taken into custody "following violent unrest". Merseyside's Police Commissioner Emily Spurrell told Radio City: "It was incredibly dangerous and there were a few injuries among the police officers."
