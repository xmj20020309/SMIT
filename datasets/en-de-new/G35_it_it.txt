Ullern, Vestre Aker, and Nordstrand formed the other districts with the fewest foreign residents. However, these districts had significantly more immigrants than in Central Oslo and Marka. Those from EU and EEA countries as well as from the United Kingdom mainly lived in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo, and St. Hanshaugen. While many citizens from Asia, including Turkey, also lived in Gamle Oslo (5,837), most were registered as residents of the districts Alna, Stovner, and Søndre Nordstrand.

Your case:
Your case: Source: Your case: Sorry, what? My friend recommended the mask from this line, so I bought that, this conditioner, and the all-in-one milk. I can't say anything about the effectiveness of the product because the smell was simply intolerable. You know that musty smell that old buildings in women's bathrooms use to cover up the smell of *ladies*, but it just turns out to be a sour, chemical, somehow musty grandma smell? Yeah, that's all I can think of when I smell it. You know, different people have different preferences, so maybe you'll like the smell. My friend said it could even help the most damaged hair, so if you don't care about the scent, then don't worry. I know natural products won't smell as nice as some synthetic ones, but I feel like more and more natural lines just don't pay as much attention to it since it sells anyway, and that's why everything smells like play-doh now. I've lost a few favorite lines because they switched the formula to cheaper ingredients. I don't know if that's the case here or if it's a fake (I called Davines and they said it's not), but it smells like I G I T T and I had to return it.  Target: Es tut mir leid, was? Mein Freund hat die Maske dieser Linie empfohlen, also habe ich das, diesen Conditioner und die All-in-One-Milch gekauft. Ich kann nichts über die Wirksamkeit des Produkts sagen, weil der Geruch einfach nicht tolerierbar war. Du kennst diesen muffigen Geruch, den alte Gebäude in den Damenklos verwenden, um den Geruch von *Damen* zu überdecken, aber es stellt sich einfach als saurer, chemischer, irgendwie muffiger Oma-Geruch heraus? Ja, das ist alles, woran ich denken kann, wenn ich das rieche. Du weißt schon, verschiedene Menschen haben verschiedene Vorlieben, also vielleicht gefällt dir der Geruch. Mein Freund sagte, es könne sogar das am meisten geschädigte Haar helfen, also wenn dir der Duft egal ist, dann keine Sorge. Ich weiß, dass natürliche Produkte nicht so hübsch riechen werden wie einige synthetische, aber ich habe das Gefühl, dass immer mehr natürliche Linien einfach weniger darauf achten, da es sowieso verkauft wird, und deshalb riecht jetzt alles nach Knete. Ich habe ein paar Lieblingslinien verloren, weil sie die Formel auf billigere Zutaten umgestellt haben. Ich weiß nicht, ob das hier der Fall ist oder ob es sich um eine Fälschung handelt (ich habe Davines angerufen und sie haben gesagt, dass es keine ist), aber das riecht nach I G I T T und ich musste es zurückgeben.

Biden's Justice Department "does not want an armed citizenry"
Your case: Source: (PERSON17) Yes, so for the multi-dialect English. We are now combining that [PERSON14] into a technical solution. The current idea that [PERSON14] is working on is that he creates new sentences with words spoken in other sentences, across different speakers. So there will really be sentences with multiple speakers, and that could also improve the robustness against the different accents of those speakers. Ah, so that's a special experiment. And later we might do a bit more in terms of multi-dialect. So, these new sentences will actually try to solve two problems with one experiment. One problem is the implicit language model. So the ASR system needs to see the maximum possible amount of sentences. And we will create new sentences from the pure text language model by adding the sound part, so that the language model for the ASR gets better and the robustness against different speakers also gets better. And in a talk yesterday I heard another idea. It was during training. They omitted time bands and frequency bands from the sound. So they trained with disturbed inputs, and that also significantly improved the robustness of the system.

Discovered the hard way that in 2023, local TV station websites are the absolute worst experience on the internet. Pop-ups, auto-playing videos, animations, overlays, and ads, ads, ads. I know advertising is their source of income, but all this junk seems counterproductive if it drives people away. This is even true now that goatse.cx is gone, although it would be a close race to the bottom between goatse and, for example, khou.com, where I tried to watch a video Wendy sent me.

Your case: Source: It's strange to do weightlifting but have no idea what your one-rep max is, because that's one of the most important methods to track progress. I train alone in my bedroom without a spotter or even a weight rack. Just me and a barbell with a lot of weights. I bench press on my bed. When I try to figure out what my one-rep max is, it might be that I don't have enough weights to max it out, or conversely, it could seriously injure/kill me. Anyway, today the weight will be increased. Still feels good.
Curious, I kept an open mind to compare how Google Maps and Apple Maps perform on my test iPhone (my daily device is an Android, so I rarely use an iPhone).

Your case: Source: Your case: The incident occurred following an increase in the number of refugees and asylum seekers crossing the English Channel in boats to reach the UK. Police have arrested 15 people after an anti-refugee demonstration outside a hotel used to accommodate asylum seekers near the English city of Liverpool turned violent. Merseyside Police said one officer and two civilians suffered minor injuries during the disturbances on Friday evening in Knowsley.

Merseyside Police Commissioner Emily Spurrell told Radio City: "It was incredibly dangerous and there were a few injuries among the police officers."
