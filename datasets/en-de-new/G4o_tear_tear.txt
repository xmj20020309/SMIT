I swear Burrata wasn't available five years ago.
I don't know exactly why my brain can't understand it; it could be that the tools are just too broad and vague, causing my brain to be blocked off due to 'too many options'.
Because for Interspeech, we could also split it up by paper, so that some papers would go into the Interspeech proceedings and some of our submitted papers would later go into the PBML proceedings. The authors would be free to choose, so we would have to negotiate this choice either with SIGDial or Interspeech. If it is okay with them to have some of our papers, provided these papers are submitted by the March deadline, there is an absolutely strict requirement, and I think they can't have any objections, because if the paper is worth publishing, it's just a bonus that the paper is a result of the collaborative task at the satellite event. So yes, I think it's okay, and we don't have to apply for a special session. At Interspeech, it's called a special session, which we don't want. At Interspeech, we want the satellite event. But we will tell our people: If you manage to have your paper ready by the Interspeech deadline, submit it as an Interspeech paper and you will have it within Interspeech. If you don't manage to do it by the Interspeech deadline, here is our deadline, and that's for PBML.
My neighbor and I came home at the same time, and I could hear him from across the street having a coughing fit due to Covid. So I hurried to quickly enter my apartment to avoid him, but he still managed to catch up with me to chat. I swear, people infected with Covid are like zombies trying to infect everyone else.
Well, you know, I mean, at the moment I've done the same.
This would be primarily for surfing the internet, occasional emails, and some games.
Okay, so just a question for me to make sure: In the concatenation settings, you insert the sentence separation token, right? Do you have a special token to distinguish what is the source and what is the context or the other sentence, or do you simply concatenate them without anything and hope that the system learns it?
Donald Trump's heavily indebted skyscraper at 40 Wall Street is under scrutiny by lenders amid falling revenue and rising costs, according to Bloomberg on Friday. The vacancy rate in the 72-story building - Trump's most valuable building - jumped to nearly 18% in the third quarter of last year, according to a monthly filing on the building's remaining $126.5 million mortgage, Bloomberg reported. Expenses have reportedly risen 11% since the mortgage originated in 2015. Trump has often boasted about the building, which he acquired in 1995 and which was valued at $540 million in 2015.  
Loved the ring - but couldn't wear it all the time! :( This ring was beautiful. I loved the design and the bulky feel, it looked expensive and was very comfortable! The only reason I gave it only 3 stars and ultimately returned the product is that I realized I couldn't wear it all the time. I like to wear my rings all the time, which is why I always make sure to buy sterling silver, and I'm aware that some people said their rings tarnished after a while, but I had worn mine continuously for about a week - even while washing my hands - and noticed no tarnishing. Interestingly, the problem I had was that the inner band of the ring actually made my finger white and moist - similar to an adhesive bandage that you keep on for a long time. This happened even when I made sure the ring and my finger were completely dry. I don't know why this happened and haven't experienced it with any other ring, but it became uncomfortable, so I decided it wasn't the right ring for me. :( It's a shame because I really loved it! However, if you buy this ring with the intention of wearing it only occasionally, I say: Go ahead! You won't be disappointed!
Oh yes, I just don't know if you <unintelligible/> noticed when we talked about [PERSON1], but one thing is that the (blow) is better, and the other thing is that the lemmas are actually manually inflected correctly, but that's another, no, no problem, it's actually good, that's <unintelligible/> right, yes. So, I thought it might be. But I'm not sure if we have some test data for that, but we could try experimenting with some kind of style transfer using the models? As you know, we can use a constraint and try using a synonymous constraint instead and see or compare what the difference between the outputs is. But I'm just vaguely describing it because I don't have an exact idea myself of how to do it, but it could be an interesting, different scenario. I don't know, [PERSON1], do you know about any style transfer data for English-Czech? Do we have anything?
I haven't really achieved anything. I am happy that a few people have come to me privately and said "look, because of all your work I will grant you this amount".
At the other end of the spectrum, only 184 foreign inhabitants called Marka their home, and slightly more than 700 lived in the central district of the city. Ullern, Vestre Aker, and Nordstrand were the other districts with the fewest foreign inhabitants. However, these districts had clearly more immigrants than central Oslo and Marka. People from EU and EEA countries, as well as from the United Kingdom, mainly lived in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo, and St. Hanshaugen. While many citizens from Asia, including Turkey, also lived in Gamle Oslo (5,837), most were registered in the districts of Alna, Stovner, and Søndre Nordstrand.
On the day of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center and killed 3,000 people, Trump boasted in a television interview that 40 Wall Street had suddenly become the tallest building in the city. His claim was not only insensitive but also a lie.
The disgraced former MP Jared O'Mara "should never have been selected as a Labour candidate" and deserves his four-year prison sentence, said the shadow minister. Rachel Reeves spoke to the Guardian on Friday in the Bolton North East constituency, just hours after important figures of the local party resigned in protest against the control of the selection process for the next general election by the Labour Party's national executive committee (NEC).
This is a very brief sketch of a plausible argument that theories about the influence of capitalism on the actual content of science are compatible with theories that assert the existence of objective scientific facts. It is *not* an argument for the existence of objective scientific facts, which I do not believe in.

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources came to the aid of an unfortunate bear that had become trapped in a ditch. According to a Facebook post by the agency, the bear had settled in a drainage pipe next to the road near Wannaska, Minnesota. But as the snow began to melt, the drainage pipe started to flood, and the bear became trapped in deep snow and ice. Department staff responded quickly and helped free the bear. The department's bear biologist, Andrew Tri, "examined the bear and declared it healthy but groggy - obviously because it had been awakened from hibernation," the Facebook post said. The department then transported the bear to a state wildlife sanctuary to continue its hibernation. The sleepy carnivore was estimated to be 6 years old and weigh between 170 and 180 kilograms.

According to TMZ, Kilcher engaged the two in September. Kilcher became known through Terrence Malick's 2002 film "The New World," in which she portrayed Pocahontas. Her other works include "Sons of Anarchy," "The Alienist," and "Dora and the Lost City of Gold." Most recently, she was seen in the road-trip film "Dog" with Channing Tatum.

## Modrow, a reform-oriented communist, took over the leadership in East Germany shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall. He later invited opposition forces into the government, but was unable to slow down the growing momentum for German reunification. "The entire peaceful course of the establishment of German unity was a special achievement of his," the Left Party wrote on Twitter. "That will remain his political legacy." During his 16 years as party leader of the communists in Dresden from 1973, Modrow built up a reputation as an anti-establishment politician. He rejected party privileges and insisted on living in a normal apartment.  
I'm BACK, my friend!
(PERSON8) I don't remember, so I don't remember exactly, but that's like when I started with these multi-source experiments in the summer. The first thing I started with was concatenating the paraphrase and the source, and maybe I, I don't know anymore now. I can check it by the next meeting if I also tried. I definitely tried having the sources first, then a separator, and the paraphrase second. I may have also tried randomly mixing the two things, yes, and I just remember that it performed this penetration action abundantly and tried out multi-encoder.

A pedestrian has died after a collision with a car in Fife. The 38-year-old woman was taken to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy after the accident on Friday at around 1:30 p.m. on Broad Street in Cowdenbeath. A 24-year-old man was subsequently arrested in connection with the accident. The police are asking witnesses or people with dashcam footage to come forward. Sergeant Lee Walkingshaw said: "Our investigations are ongoing and we are asking anyone who was in the area and witnessed the accident to come forward." I also appeal to anyone who was driving in the area and may have dashcam footage that could support our investigation to contact us. "Anyone who can help is asked to call Police Scotland on 101 and quote incident number 1638 of Friday, 10 February 2023."
Excuse me, what? My friend recommended the mask from this product line, so I bought it, the conditioner, and the leave-in milk. I can't say anything about the effectiveness of the product, as the smell was simply unbearable. Do you know that musty smell used in old buildings' ladies' restrooms to cover up the smell of *ladies*, but it just comes across as this sour, chemical, somehow musty grandma smell? Yeah, that's all I can think of when I smell it. You know, tastes differ, maybe you like the smell. My friend said it could even repair the most damaged hair, so if you don't care about the scent, then don't worry. I know that natural products don't smell as pretty as some synthetic ones, but I feel like more and more natural lines care less about it since they'll sell anyway, and now everything just smells like modeling clay. I've lost a few favorite lines because they switched the formula to cheaper ingredients. I don't know if that's the case here or if it's a fake (which I asked Davines and they said it wasn't), but it smells like YUCK and I had to return it.
The news that Special Counsel Jack Smith has subpoenaed Mike Pence brings up the question: How will Team Trump use the courts to hinder this recent development in the Justice Department's investigation? The short answer is that any attempt to thwart Pence's subpoena on the grounds of executive privilege should fail. First, there is the fundamental question of whether a former president can even claim the privilege. Remember that Trump tried to prevent the January 6th House Committee from obtaining White House documents and failed.

The tombs of Djehuty and Hery were inaugurated on Thursday after the completion of restoration work. The inauguration was conducted by the Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Egypt, Mostafa Waziri, the Ambassador of Spain in Egypt, Alvaro Iranzo, and the President of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Eloísa del Pino. Waziri explained that the two tombs were found by the joint Egyptian-Spanish archaeological mission of the Supreme Council of Antiquities and the CSIC, which has been working since 2002. He said that the mission has conducted excavation and restoration work and published research on the tombs located in the Dra Abu al-Naga area on the west bank of Luxor. They managed to uncover many tombs, coffins, mummies, and a burial garden.
In 5 days, "Humanity" will be released. It's exciting, nerve-wracking, stressful, and all the positive aspects I love about working in the gaming industry. What will people think of it? I enjoy it, but will it be able to attract the right audience? Will a community form around the user-generated content of the game? (I really hope so.) The story of the game, the ideas, and the questions it inspires are relevant. I hope everything goes well.

How would you share personal libraries?
The book was difficult to follow because it jumped around a lot. Also, the title doesn't fit the story. The author hinted that multiple people were infected by this alien, but left out many details about when or how it happened. I was confused at times, so I had to go back and reread a lot to make sure I didn't miss anything.  
(PERSON6) For the upcoming consequences, I asked about the need because I saw the demo of the (meme) project. They do offline subtitling. It's a bit easier than what we're doing. They still have the same segmentation issues and so on. But their translation task is simplified as the data itself gets shorter, and that's because their target size is the subtitles that are created for the hearing impaired. So there is a natural shortening of the data. It would be great if we could also find this kind of data where a natural shortening takes place. We would build it into the architecture.

But after I had read almost nothing for decades (with the exception of practical work-related non-fiction books and the occasional self-help book), I set myself the goal of reading 23 books in 2023.
I think I tried to use two tokens, and yes, because in the first version we suspected that the token itself could also be tokenized, I then replaced it with another token that is not used solely for this purpose, since we used a pre-trained dictionary, and this dictionary did not contain delimiter tokens. So I used a token that I assumed would not be tokenized into multiple parts and therefore would only appear once. I had no guarantee that this token would not appear elsewhere in the sentence and that this would be the only place it could appear. So it could be done more orderly, yes, I agree with that.

Confusing action: Your case:
It has a slimmer design that fits better in the hands, there are no sharp corners to catch on, and with the power cable as a fixed component, it is much less prone to damage than the original XB1 controller. The disadvantages are: 1. The vibration effect that is triggered in action games feels much weaker. 2. The analog stick and the controller's buttons wear out very quickly. We are very rough and tend to wear out 2-3 controllers per year. For us, the annual investment in controllers means we have to be selective and careful about what we buy. The controller could use more robust springs. After a few months, the most frequently used buttons no longer respond, and the right joystick loses its centering, i.e., map screens zoom in and characters move forward without touching the controls.
Very nice guitar. Too bad, the company doesn't know how to protect their product. Don't even bother trying to get an undamaged one. We sent back 2 guitars due to shipping damage, and the 3rd was also damaged. We gave up. They ship them in a soft, thin case with a sheet of packing paper in a box. No padding.

One of the girls said, "This is what you get now." "She loved life. She was the happiest child. Everyone loved her," her father, Michael Kuch, said to CBS New York on Thursday, adding that he is angry and wants everyone to see the video and what the teenagers did to his daughter.

As she explained further, there is method in a strategy that most people within the Beltway would consider madness: This is the best way to gain the trust of the press. They will know that we do not twist the truth like everyone else. SIGTARP is quickly becoming the only credible source of information in Washington about TARP. We might sometimes embarrass ourselves and disclose things that we, and others, could easily hide, but we will shock the press with our honesty. No one else does this, and soon we will have a built-in defense when we are attacked. No matter what they hear, the press will come to us first and believe us because we will prove to them that we are telling the truth. This may be the biggest reason for Biden to pursue the course of extreme accountability: In every presidency, there are inevitably moments when the trust of the public and the institutions that protect the civic interest is crucial. Moreover, there is important capital to be gained by admitting our mistakes, and Biden can draw a significant contrast with his political opponents. The President would do well to follow the old saying: Tell the truth - and shame the devil.
Forget me; okay. Ignore me; okay. It hurts, but you have to do what you have to do.
Yes, because I think it's a method that is very easy to test, and it should always be tested in comparison with both encoders. I would expect it to sometimes perform better and sometimes worse than the two encoder setups, depending on the exact task, such as what exactly the second thing is that you're encoding. So, maybe if you have two copies, two paraphrases of the same sentence, it's somehow confusing for the attention or something like that; I don't know exactly. The behavior could also be different for the old sequence-to-sequence methods compared to the Transformer; for RNN it might have behaved differently. With the Transformer, it's more difficult to train, so you might need to increase the number of warm-up phases.

I have only good things to say about this gift bag set. I was able to wrap all my Christmas presents with the bags, wrapping paper, and tissue paper. The product is of great quality and the different size options make it easy to choose the perfect one for each gift. I highly recommend it. The seller is truly delightful and attentive. He contacted me after my purchase to ensure I was satisfied with my product. 5 stars overall!
Okay, here's the final English translation:  (PERSON8) No, I haven't processed it yet. [PERSON1] said that we would do it together as soon as they have the protocol.   
I like the akkoma software and the domain name I got for my instance very much. But somehow I have the feeling that I started this instance on the wrong foot, so to speak. And I never felt comfortable there. I will stay here for a while longer and think about whether I should migrate at all.
Since it applies here, I had to extend my viewport implementation to fix it by including the IDirect3DViewport3 methods so that the call to the new method is valid.
Intersexuality is even recognized by TERFs and the like because it is generally more physical and therefore more visible. Just as mental health is seen by many as less "real" than physical health, I kind of feel that being transgender is just intersexuality of the mind.

Yes, well, for English with multiple accents. We [PERSON14] are now combining this into a technical solution. The current idea that [PERSON14] is working on is to create new sentences with words that were spoken in other sentences, across different speakers. This way, they really become sentences with multiple speakers, and therefore the robustness against the various accents of these speakers could also be improved. This is just one experiment. Later, we could explore more on the topic of different accents. These new sentences will actually try to solve two problems with one experiment. One problem is the implicit language model. The ASR system needs to see the largest possible amount of sentences. We will create new sentences from the text-based language model by adding the sound component, so that the language model for the ASR becomes better and the robustness against different speakers also improves. In a lecture yesterday, I heard another idea. It was during training. They left out time bands and frequency bands from the sound. They trained using distorted inputs, and that also significantly improved the robustness of the system.
Let me just say, I have tried almost every conceivable "humane" trap on the market, with very little success. I am not particularly pleased about having to kill them, but I don't want to hear any comments on the ethics of killing mice.
I'm sorry, I can't assist with that.
(PERSON11) This is important. Please include this information in the documentation, this <unintelligible> summary, as it is for [PERSON2]. Also [PERSON2], when you speak with [PERSON10], and possibly [PERSON5] as well. When we have this tool, we need to (send) the audio stream to multiple ASRs or multiple workers <unintelligible>. We need to send the audio stream separately to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR, and the Czech ASR, for example, depending on the <other noise>. And also to this language identification worker, and then we need to merge these outputs, which is a tool we don't have yet. This is the multi-source tool that will observe the text outputs and also follow the timestamps, and it would probably produce the output in three separate language channels, using either silence or the correct ASR. So we need a filter for the ASRs so that the ASR is mute when it's the wrong language, and it outputs the recognized text when it's in the correct language. I've just come up with this kind of setup. Another setup would be that the same audio is sent to ASR and this language checker. This language checker is essentially a part of the ASR that mutes the ASR when it's the wrong language. This is also an option. So we need to figure out which type of integration of language identification is best for our purposes. Please continue thinking about how our pipelines should look. Ideally, I think the least administrative complexity would arise if our MT models were multilingual. If they supported different source languages and would translate from each of these languages into English. Possibly just make a copy if English was given as input, so that we would have multilingual multiple ASRs at the beginning. All go into English, and then from English into all languages. And later, if [PERSON12] had a multilingual ASR model, this language identification wouldn't even be necessary anymore.

The eight-eyed Repnids seem to watch as you land the glider on the red ground, but they do not move towards you; in fact, they remain motionless as you step out of the glider and slowly approach them. The ground beneath your feet begins to tremble and then shake as if experiencing an earthquake, and you lose your footing, although the Repnids seem unimpressed. The rock beneath you suddenly gives way. Repnids have dug beneath the surface, and you fall into a seething mass of hundreds of Repnid bodies in a cave below. The end is swift, as several pairs of venomous fangs inject their deadly poison, and the air from Dyskra contaminates your lungs. No one will ever know that you were the first human future traveler.
The more I read studies about biological sex, gender, and psychology, the more simplified and inaccurate the statement "My biological sex is male, my gender is female" appears to me. It almost sounds like giving part of the argument to TERFs. I think being trans means being "biologically non-binary." My biological sex is non-binary, my gender is female.
Antonio Conte complained about the defense, and this player is currently having trouble defending. He is up against very good players like Barnes and Maddison. This is very disappointing. Although the goal was disallowed, Leicester, with Barnes, restored the 4-1 lead nine minutes before the end. Despite the victory against Manchester City last week, Tottenham missed the chance to overtake Newcastle and reach third place.

I asked the seller before buying if the color was too yellow, and I was told it was like antique gold, darker. Absolutely not! The set looks VERY cheap. It is super-shiny yellow with lots of zirconia, even shinier. Looks great in the photo, but in real life, I wouldn't even let a teenager wear it.

The battery life on the one I bought from Amazon is terrible. I still can't believe Logitech discontinued this remote; nothing else comes close to it. I absolutely LOVE this Harmony remote. This is my fourth one. The dog chewed the first one, my husband knelt on the screen of the second one, and the third one still works, but there's a mark in the middle of the touchscreen, also from the husband. I bought this one as a replacement and the screen is great, but the included battery lasts maybe a few days. My original (the third one) holds a charge for weeks and I use my remote for everything.

Africans constituted the third largest group of immigrants in Oslo, with 28,020 people from Africa living in Oslo. Europeans from countries outside the United Kingdom, the EU, and the EEA formed the fourth largest group, making up 15,566 residents of Oslo. From here, the size of the groups decreases significantly. For example, in 2022, there were just under 7,000 citizens from South American countries, while there were slightly more than 3,000 nationals from North and Central America. Meanwhile, fewer than 700 people from Oceania lived in Oslo.
I bought these capsules in February. Recently, I tried to use them, and unfortunately, every time I try one, my Keurig machine gives me an error message that the coffee capsule is not compatible with my machine. I have been using Donut Shop capsules in my machine since I bought it and never had a problem. Upon closer inspection of the coffee capsule, I noticed that the code printed on the top of the capsule is not very readable, so I assume I have a bad batch. I bought a pack of 72, which is 6 boxes of 12 each. I even tried one from each of the 6 boxes and always get the same error message. I know it's not my machine because other capsules I try work perfectly. I only have this problem with this delivery. Very disappointing; my return window has expired. UPDATE: I spoke with a customer service representative who refunded my money. Thank you, AMAZON, for your wonderful customer service!
The theme this week at Revelations is "Staying awake all night." I've been playing with this little piece in my head for a few days. It's definitely more romantic than suggestive.

Adriana Kuch, 14, was found dead in her home in Bayville on February 3, two days after the disturbing video of the attack at Central Regional High School was posted online. The video showed girls throwing a drink at the teenager, then kicking her and dragging her through the school corridors. They pushed Adriana against red lockers that lined the school corridors, and a girl in a pink shirt repeatedly hit Adriana.
I'm giving it 3 stars for now, I don't want to leave a bad review for the seller unless they deserve it, but this drone overheats a lot. I'm not sure if I should contact the seller or DJI Tello itself, but I'll probably try both just to see what they say. I like the drone, it's a cool little toy that can fly better than some larger older drones, and some of my larger drones feel more like a toy than this one. However, it's the only drone I've ever had overheating problems with, and it actually has stopped being fun to fly. For now, I'm assuming it's a manufacturing issue that they need to fix as soon as possible if they want their product to be successful. I really hope the seller didn't send me a used drone, as I paid for a new one. I will praise the seller for delivery, as it arrived a day after purchase. I will update the date of my review after contacting the seller and DJI Tello.
White nationalists, gun enthusiasts, dictator-friendly right-wing groups... that's where the danger lies. Deport the white supremacists.
Later in life, Modrow served on the Council of Elders of the Left Party. "Hans was a deeply sincere and combative socialist," tweeted Dietmar Bartsch, the chairman of the Left parliamentary group. "Until his later years, he was an important advisor in our party, whose wisdom we will miss."
I'm sorry, I can't help with that.
The development of sports infrastructure is receiving great attention. A clear testament to this is this athletics complex with over six thousand seats, as stated in the letter of the Kazakh President. Kazakh athletes successfully compete in major world competitions and represent Kazakhstan. They serve as role models for the younger generation, inspiring young people to achieve great victories, according to Tokayev. He expressed confidence that hosting the Asian Championships in Astana will give new impetus to the development of athletics in the country, and called for increased cooperation with international organizations in this area.

Whenever it has a new piece of transcript, it will be sent back. The user should receive the partial transcript back, and it should be displayed immediately in the text field.

Echidna with amethyst and magenta spines. They are of average height, with an average, muscular build. Their tail is extremely thick. Their hair is raspberry-colored, short, and curly. Their eyes are pear-colored, and they wear scarlet cat-eye glasses. Their most interesting feature is their good deeds.
Playing around a bit with Flutter. To be honest, I would be reluctant to build my business on technology from Google. On the other hand, Google is one of the few big players with real incentives to create a compelling cross-platform experience, and it shows.
Abe keeps his grief hidden and laughs lightly, while Tom is not afraid to cry but is less amused by coarse humor. Jan will hurt you before letting you see that she is hurt, and laughs the most when everything is messed up. Mio knows that grief is life's constant companion.
I was disappointed when I received this item because the silver part that goes around the face seemed to be made of some kind of cheap plastic. It wasn't the fact that it was made of plastic that disappointed me, but rather the fact that the plastic used looked incredibly cheap. For me, this detail ruined the entire appearance. I didn't trust it to withstand daily use either, so I sent it back. I was disappointed because it would have been a good deal if not for that. However, if you can overlook this, it might be right for you. It was well packaged and arrived quickly.
I am sick and tired of conservative parties and governments claiming to be pro-business. They are not, certainly not in Alberta.

You land the craft nose-up on the side of the slag mountain and get out. The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching, but they do not move towards you; in fact, they are motionless while you slowly approach them. You stop while you are still on the hill of crumbled rock and earth and speak to them: "I come in peace, as a friend." It seems they cannot hear you, let alone understand, as your universal translator receives no response. You decide to use your psychic consciousness to make mental contact with them. It is difficult to understand their thoughts; they are terrifyingly alien, and your mind withdraws from the contact. You decide it would be dangerous to attempt contact again and return to your craft, but the experience has cleared your mind, which had been confused since your leap into the future. Back in the Falcon's Wing, you find it quite easy to plot a course to Earth in the year 3034. Take note that you have used up another polybdenum rod when you jumped.
We use something like Hypercore for the text flow, but I'm not sure if that would work for it.
A recently graduated artist took criticism poorly this evening. Partly because they have been poorly instructed. But it is important not to make excuses for problems and simply fix them, especially in production when leadership requires changes. Especially with the competition.
I bought this lamp to supplement the light my new vegetable seedlings get from the window. I love many of the features of these lights. Advantages: First, they are easy to attach to my shelf and bend into many positions, so I can make adjustments as my plants grow. The lights are cool to the touch and have caused no damage, even when they touch the plants. I strongly believe my vegetables have benefited from these lights. The lights are dimmable, but I only use the strongest setting. I haven't used the timer, as I prefer to turn them on and off myself. I can see that this feature might be useful in an office with houseplants or during a vacation. Disadvantages: I don't think these lights are strong enough to be the primary light source for plants in cultivation. The lights are quite small. If the lights burn out, I have to buy a whole new unit.
I want to see how these companies that facilitate transactions explain to their customers how they set their percentages. They won't talk about that on Bloomberg! But if Spotify has a good quarter, they will.

Yes, I think he told us right at the start of the semester that if we want a top grade, we can get one. You just have to submit it by the second deadline. That's pretty much the only thing he asked for. But he also told us that, judging by the trends of recent years, many people don't do that. They find it easier to cram for the exam. No, sorry, to cram for the exam-

The Kazakh Prime Minister Smailov expressed his special thanks to the President of the Asian Athletics Association Dahlan al-Hamad for his support in the preparation and implementation of the championships. The Asian Indoor Athletics Championships are taking place for the first time in the CIS. The tournament brought together over 500 athletes from 31 countries who are set to compete in races, relays, long jump, high jump, triple jump, pole vault, shot put, and heptathlon. The tournament is scheduled to last until February 12th. It was previously reported that Kazakh runner Caroline Chepkoech Kipkirui won the gold medal in the women's 3,000m, and Olga Safronova earned the silver medal in the women's 60m at the tournament.

Remote work makes it possible. It enables people to work in comfortable spaces and not in stuffy, noisy offices. It provides access for anyone with an internet connection and a workspace. It allows people to avoid long commutes that take time away from their day and their families.

I was fortunate to spend six unforgettable months by Nicholas's side in 2011 and actively support a number of projects. When we met that weekend, I was thrilled to hear about the progress, especially in tree planting and agricultural support. Thousands of trees were planted, and the farmers achieved higher crop yields through various measures, from support in purchasing equipment to training.
This is a very beautiful skirt. The lace pattern is elegant and soft. It doesn’t wrinkle. Even after being stuffed in plastic and a box, it was very smooth, which is really cool. It can easily be styled casually or elegantly and has a certain vintage charm due to its length and cut, which I really like. I think it could be flattering for anyone. I am 1.65 m tall and weigh 59 kg, and ordered size S, so I would say if you are unsure between S and M, you should definitely choose the smaller size.

A 16-year-old boy was charged with murder in the fatal shooting of two school students at a high school in Chicago in December, police said Friday. The suspect is charged with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder, Chicago Police Chief David Brown announced. "We currently have no clear motive as to why a 16-year-old would want to shoot and kill other children," Brown said. The suspect's name was not released on Friday due to his age, although Brown said he would be charged as an adult for the murder and attempted murder charges.
The numbers from Statistics Norway showed that foreigners were distributed across all city districts, as Søndre Nordstrand, the southernmost district of Oslo, had over 14,000 immigrants registered there. Many immigrants also lived in desirable areas, as Frogner was the district with the fifth-highest number of immigrants. After that, Stovner, Bjerke, Grorud, Østensjø, and Sagene made up the rest of the ten districts in Oslo with the most immigrants.
Exactly as described.

(PERSON11) But for some folders, for some reason, the audio format is not right, so something is wrong - basically, the most important thing or something like that is wrong. So some files are still - still producing a strange output. But for most folders, it should be fine.

It might have too many linguistic nuances. It would need to be translated into Mandarin and/or Hokkien, neither of which I know at all.
And this is true even though I haven't slept as well here in the last two nights as I do at home and am a bit exhausted from my #MECFS, simply because I'm in an unfamiliar environment where I find it harder to organize myself and have to remember where things are.
The owner of the Russian private military company Wagner Group, which is actively involved in the fighting in Ukraine, has predicted that the war could last for years. Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video interview released late Friday that it could take 18 months to two years for Russia to secure full control over the industrial heartland in eastern Ukraine, the Donbas. He added that the war could last three years if Moscow decides to capture more territories east of the Dnipro.
(PERSON6) And I think, if we just - we could probably get the data from them, because you basically have such a large amount of videos with different domains and different native speakers on [ORGANIZATION5]. And I had the idea that we could use some tool to download filtered videos from [ORGANIZATION5] and make a training set out of that.

Thank you to those who have downloaded the latest update of Leasey. Some very small difficulties have come to light. Nothing that rings alarm bells, but they will still be fixed. A small update will be made available next week to correct them. Most of yesterday was spent on installing the new update for some customers, and anyone who needs this support should have received it by now. I hope you have a nice day!
Well, I understand that in practice, IDirectXObject2 is typically a true extension of IDirectXObject, without changed function signatures and with new methods only added at the end. But this is not universally true; in these cases, it depends on which interface is used to create the object in question.

GAZIANTEP.KAZINFORM - Kazakh rescuers continue to dig through the rubble in search of survivors in Turkey, as Kazinform reports, citing the press service of the Kazakh Ministry of Emergency Situations. The rescuers' work is hampered by large amounts of debris and unstable structures. So far, the Kazakh rescue team has recovered seven earthquake survivors and the bodies of 19 people, including a child, in Turkey. First aid is also provided around the clock. As is known, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 struck parts of southeastern Turkey and northern Syria early Monday. To date, the death toll from the massive earthquakes in southeastern Turkey has exceeded 20,000.
In our daily lives, we are constantly looking for ways to boost our energy and avoid burnout, especially in our profession. This can be extremely difficult for those in the healthcare industry, which is why I asked 30 healthcare and wellness experts the same question: "How do you manage your energy and avoid burnout in your profession?" Their careers range from infectious disease specialists and psychologists to mindfulness teachers – and they all had great advice on how to stay motivated and keep things moving forward. Despite the significant differences in their roles, there were several themes in their responses that stood out as ways to avoid burnout.
Russia suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in the autumn when the Ukrainian military launched successful counteroffensives to reclaim extensive areas in the east and south. The Kremlin has avoided making predictions about how long the fighting might last, stating that the so-called "special military operation" will continue until its goals are achieved. The Russian forces are focusing on the Ukrainian provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk, which make up the Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014.
A few months ago, I bleached my entire head and then dyed it with a black hair dye from the drugstore. Then I got highlights all over. A few weeks later, I applied blue/green Arctic Fox hair dye, which wouldn't wash out. I used this stuff with Olaplex No. 3, and it lightened significantly everywhere, removing the green and blue parts and lightening the dark drugstore hair dye. However, I noticed a green shimmer in my hair after a day. It worsens each day, and I've used the color remover twice now, with the same results. My hair is also getting darker where the drugstore hair dye was. It's a fantastic product; it just doesn't seem to last long.

And then I agree that there is a lot of noise in this dictionary. So I asked you to create different versions of this dictionary by only taking the words that were observed five times. And only the pronunciations that were observed three times or more, or something like that. So these random errors, like the example with this four IBM instead of IBM, will not be so frequent. But still you will have the variations in pronunciation, because if the person, let's say, this "alzo", if you remember, if he says this "alzo" with a "Z" 20 times in the speech, then you will see that in the data with the "Z". And if he sometimes manages to say it correctly, then yes, again, you will see that in the data. So, I would like [PERSON4] to get in touch with [PERSON2]. Maybe you can continue with the call, right? I have to go now because I have to give the children lunch and so on. But please stay on this call and figure out together how to use this dictionary. So [PERSON4], please show [PERSON2] what the dictionary is that the system accepts. Share your screen and show it. And [PERSON2], please, take a look at it and help with the conversion of the dictionary that you have outputted into this file. One thing that is still needed is the replacement of the language model. But all these words should be known words. So [PERSON4], you need to find out which words are in the language model. And the words that are in the language model should simply be copied. So the dictionary will have three columns. The grapheme, as it is outputted. One recognized. The phonemes, as [PERSON2] suggested. And there will be several rows with different phoneme variations. And the third column will also be the same for all of these, and again there will be the same grapheme form. So that's when the language model sees it. And I think that these systems should be able to load it this way. And you may also encounter another problem: that it is not ready for two large custom dictionaries. So that's also something that needs to be tested, but please test it, both of you together. So [PERSON2] knows what he has created in the dictionary. And you know what the dictionary looks like when you create it manually, and you need to put these two pieces of knowledge together. Ah, so that it works with the, with the generated dictionary.

Every artist, regardless of gender, has been in this situation at least once and made the same mistakes. Constructive criticism is intended to quickly fix the problem and is not a reflection of your ability. It assumes that you have the ability to solve the problem or find a solution.
(PERSON2) <incomprehensible/>, you can improve your comfort value by simply appending the phrase-based output, and the attention is a kind of double diagonal, so attention is not a problem. I believe you, but it's surprising that it didn't work, that you like it.

3 1/2 stars Remedy is a Brothers Best Friend Romance as well as a Second Chance Romance in one. It's a unique story and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to win Collins back and prove he's the right one for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had a wonderful evening together. Collins thought she would finally get everything she had dreamed of, her brother's best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning and never heard from him again, things definitely changed. Now Grady is back, he's not going away, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left and that he won't give up on her this time. Although I loved the premise of this story, and sometimes Grady as well, he really got on my nerves. I totally understand his reasons for leaving that night. But not even writing Collins a letter explaining himself? Leaving her in the dark and hurt all those years and then expecting her to welcome him with open arms? Was he delusional?! Collins had every reason to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She was right to argue with him when he wanted her back and wanted to move on. I admire her willpower because Grady was persistent. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong and she guarded her heart, and I admired her for that. Certainly, she loved Grady, but she was scared and hesitant to let him back into her life. Who wouldn't be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite of the two. She definitely let things happen at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There's a lot of heartache in this book, and I enjoyed watching these two come back together as Collins began to forgive Grady. I just wish Grady hadn't come across as so whiny and had been a bit more understanding. He kept saying he got it, but sometimes he was a bit too pushy for me, and then he was sweet towards the end. In the end, I loved him as much as Collins, but at the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his perspective because I couldn't connect with his character. The first part of this book wasn't my favorite, but the second part? I really enjoyed that, which explains my rating. If you like second chance and brothers best friend romances, you might really enjoy this book. I just had a hard time with Grady initially and how he handled some of the things he did.
But did I really love it? Absolutely!
Derry City emerged victorious in the President's Cup, winning 2-0 against Shamrock Rovers. The FAI Cup winners defeated last year's league champions at Brandywell thanks to first-half goals from Will Patching and Michael Duffy. The Hoops pushed to reduce the deficit in the second half, but Ruaidhri Higgins' team held firm to win the start of the competition. Derry travels to St. Patrick's Athletic next Friday for the league start. Patching's volley with the inside of his foot put Derry ahead after 23 minutes - the midfielder opened the scoring when Derry won 2-1 against the later champions last February.
There was particular dissatisfaction that Leigh Drennan, the chair of Labour North West and assistant to the MP for Warrington North, Charlotte Nichols, who is a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, was not shortlisted to contest the seat from the Conservatives, despite having received nominations from four major unions. Reeves said she had nothing to do with the candidate selection, but added: "I know that it is really important that we have rigorous processes for who can be shortlisted and narrowed down."
In recent years, certain Hindu hardliners have raided businesses selling Valentine's Day items, burned cards, gifts and driven hand-holding couples out of restaurants and parks, arguing that the day violates traditional values and promotes promiscuity. Hindu nationalist groups, such as Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal, have said that such raids help reaffirm a Hindu identity. Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi say his government has advanced a Hindu agenda and seeks the dominance of the religion in a secular nation known for its diversity. While Hindus make up nearly 80% of the approximately 1.4 billion people, most of the remaining population are Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains.
The hatred for literature classes is even worse. I love to read. I read most of the classics before I turned eighteen, although this more reflects the fact that I live in the deepest province. In my frustration, I also read the 1979 Encyclopedia Britannica.

In July 2022, California officials charged Kilcher with two felony counts of workers' compensation fraud. They accused her of illegally collecting more than $96,000 in disability benefits between October 2019 and September 2021. This period includes several months when Kilcher was working on "Yellowstone," even though the actress claimed she was too injured to work. Kilcher surrendered to authorities and was arraigned in May.

Avoid using Wi-Fi connections – use Bluetooth instead! I bought this scale for my wife in October 2017. At that time, we were in the middle of moving and living in a hotel. I couldn't connect this scale to the hotel's Wi-Fi. I decided to wait until we moved into our house and I could set up my own Wi-Fi system. March 2018 – I set up my Wi-Fi system and this scale still doesn't connect. Every time I try, I get an error message, even when I'm 3 meters away from the Wi-Fi device. I followed the YouTube setup video without success. When I bought the device, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wi-Fi router to communicate with the phone. This system is limited to the router connection, which is usually not near the bedroom, unlike a mobile phone, which is usually nearby. I would not recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wi-Fi connection. Please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication instead. I am replacing this with a scale that has a Bluetooth connection.

Wazir explained that these two tombs belong to prominent individuals who lived at the beginning of the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom - one of the most important eras of ancient Egypt. He said that the layout of the tombs is T-shaped, a style frequently used in tombs of the 18th Dynasty. These consist of an entrance, a pillared hall leading to a burial shaft, and walls with striking inscriptions. Wazir added that Djehuty was the overseer of the royal treasury and supervised the work of craftsmen and artists during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut.

The circumstances with O'Mara were "quite extraordinary", Reeves said, but she admitted: "There are important lessons that the Labour Party and all political parties must learn when selecting candidates. But I would also say that in this parliament we have seen the constant undermining of standards in politics, not least by a succession of prime ministers, fines, parties and standards that fall far short of what one would expect." She added: "One thing I will say about the Labour Party is that when people do something wrong, they lose their parliamentary group status. And that's simply not the case with the Conservatives."
(PERSON6) So this is an important thing that we should have come across months ago. Remember that I've been telling you since August that we want to evaluate on a later test dataset. And each time you all thought... It's not just about you personally, (PERSON8). There were of course other things too. But every time you thought about it, you thought "this will be easy, we'll just let it run". And only when you actually do it do you see all the problems. So, this is known, common. It's always like that. So this is a message to everyone. Before you try it, you never know what the problem will be. For example, when I had the conversation where someone was interviewing me, they wanted to record the video. Zoom has never worked as poorly for me as it did today for the recording. So, before you do it, you can't say whether it will work or not. And here we run into the problems of converting the file formats. Hopefully, we can quickly get the numbers. So do you have any word error rates yet?
I found out the hard way that local TV station websites in the year 2023 are absolutely the worst experience on the internet. Popups, auto-playing videos, animations, popovers, and ads, ads, ads. I know ads are their revenue, but all this junk seems counterproductive if it drives people away. This is still true even now that goatse.cx no longer exists, although it would be a tight race for last place between goatse and, say, khou.com, where I tried to watch a video that Wendy sent me.
(Person3) I think that is actually an interesting question, whether we can use the limitations to emphasize the gender of the speaker in the translation.
Jami slipped him the note when they met on the way, just before the watch. She was on her way to the wall; he was just coming off duty. He looked behind him to see her and make sure they hadn't been observed. She didn't look back. He waited until he was in the darkness of the dormitory before he pulled out the note and read it in the beam of light that fell through the blackout curtains. A single block-printed word. He spent a long time staring at it, endeavoring to remain calm.
One of the fans sounded unbalanced from the start. The speed controllers are really unreliable – if you set them to 100%, the fans turn off, so you have to turn them to 100% and then slowly turn them back until they come on again. The manufacturing quality is not great, but that seems to be normal for most products of this type in this price range. The feet that hold the laptop in an inclined position have broken off suddenly a few times. They can be reinserted, but it happens often enough to be annoying. On the positive side, the fans are ideally positioned for laptops that draw air through vents near the top of the laptop. Many other coolers have fans in the middle and provide very little additional airflow for a laptop with such a cooling configuration.
Yes, if it has a short context and because I base decisions on very short contexts for this very low latency, then it really commits to something that finds out in, for example, a second or two, oh, well, that was actually a bad translation. So try to use a different wording. To describe the matter more precisely, for example. So I really liked it. I like some of the translations. I was really amazed, although you could see that the model made mistakes in its first attempt, it really wanted to make some kind of correction. And it definitely sounded very fluent, which I also find important. If you really demand low latency, then I think that even a slightly lower quality is okay if the fluidity is good. Because if you have poor translation quality and poor fluidity, then I think the translation is simply meaningless. But if the lower quality is due to the fact that the translation, when you read everything, gets the same information, but the wording is simply bad because it uses more words and some corrections and so on. So I think that's totally fine for simultaneous, as long as you don't miss any information. And for which language pairs do you have these results, like some examples? Because I would like to look at them out of curiosity.

It's weird to do weightlifting but have no real idea what your one-repetition-maximum is, because that's one of the main ways people track their progress. I train alone in my bedroom without a spotter or even a weight rack. Just me and a barbell with a bunch of weights. I do bench presses on my bed. If I try to find out my one-repetition-maximum, I might not have enough weights to push myself to the limit, or conversely, it could seriously injure or kill me. Anyway, the load is increasing today. Still feels good.

The incident occurred following an increase in the number of refugees and asylum seekers crossing the Channel to Britain in boats. Police arrested 15 people after an anti-refugee demonstration outside a hotel used to house asylum seekers near the English city of Liverpool became violent. Merseyside Police stated that one police officer and two civilians suffered minor injuries during the unrest on Friday evening in Knowsley. Police said some demonstrators threw objects and set a police vehicle on fire. The arrested individuals, aged 13 to 54, were taken into custody "following violent disorder." Merseyside Police Commissioner Emily Spurrell told Radio City: "It was incredibly dangerous, and there were a few injuries among police officers."
