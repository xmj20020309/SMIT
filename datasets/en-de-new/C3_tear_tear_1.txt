I swear, Burrata didn't exist five years ago.
I don't know exactly why my brain can't figure it out; it could be because the tools are simply so wide-ranging and vague that my brain is simply blocked due to "too many possibilities."
For Interspeech, we could also divide it paper by paper. So that some papers would go into the Interspeech proceedings. And some of our submissions would later come for the PBML proceedings. And the authors would have the freedom to choose. We have to negotiate this with either SIGDial or Interspeech. It's okay for them to have some of our papers, provided that those papers are submitted by the March deadline. So, that's an absolutely strict requirement, and I think they can't have anything against it because if the paper is worth publishing, it's just a bonus that the paper contains some shared task results that appear at the Satellite event. So yes, I think it's fine. We don't have to ask for a special session. At Interspeech it's called a special session, which we don't want. At Interspeech we want the Satellite event. But we will tell our people: If you manage to have your paper ready by the Interspeech deadline, submit it as an Interspeech paper, and you will have it within Interspeech. Ah, if you don't make it by the Interspeech deadline, here is our deadline, and that's for PBML.
My neighbor and I arrived home at the same time, and I could hear him coughing vigorously from COVID across the street. I hurried to get into my apartment to avoid him, but he still managed to catch up with me for a conversation. I swear, people infected with COVID are like zombies trying to infect everyone else.
Yes, well, I mean, at the moment I'm doing the same thing.
The device would be primarily intended for internet use, occasional email reading, and some games.
Okay, just a question for me to make sure, in the concatenation settings you insert the sentence separator, right? You have a special token to distinguish what the source is and what the context or the other sentence is, or do you just chain them without anything, and hope that the system learns it?
Donald Trump's heavily borrowed skyscraper at 40 Wall Street is on the "lender watchlist" due to declining revenues and rising costs, Bloomberg reported on Friday. The vacancy rate in the 72-story building - Trump's most valuable - rose to nearly 18% in the third quarter of last year, according to a monthly report on the remaining $126.5 million real estate loan. Meanwhile, expenses have allegedly increased by 11% since the loan's inception in 2015. Trump has often boasted about the building, which he acquired in 1995 and was valued at $540 million in 2015.
Loved the ring - but couldn't wear it all the time! :( This ring was beautiful. I loved the design and the solid appearance; it looked expensive and was very comfortable! The only reason I gave it 3 stars and ultimately returned the product is that I found I couldn't wear it all the time. I like to wear my rings all the time, which is why I always make sure to get sterling silver, and I know some people said their rings had discolored after a while, but I had worn mine continuously for about a week - even while washing my hands - and didn't notice any discoloration. Interestingly, the problem was that the inner ring actually made my finger turn white and moist - similar to a bandage when you wear it for a long time. This also happened when I made sure the ring and my finger were completely dry. I don't know why this happened and have never had it happen with any other ring, but it became uncomfortable, so I decided it wasn't the right ring for me. :( Too bad, because I really liked it! So if you are buying this ring with the intention of only wearing it occasionally, I say: Go for it!! You won't be disappointed!
Oh yes, I don't know if you caught it when we were talking about [PERSON1], but one thing is that the (blow) is better, but the other thing is that the lemmas are actually correctly manually inflected, but that's a different, not a problem. It's actually good that it's <unintelligible/> correct, yes. So, I thought it could be. But I'm not sure if we have test data for that, but we could try to try out some kind of style transfer with the models. As you know, we can use a constraint and try to use a synonymous constraint instead and see or compare what the difference is between the outputs. But that's because I'm only vaguely describing it because I don't have an exact idea myself of how to do it, but it could have been an interesting, independent scenario. I don't know, [PERSON1], do you know anything about style transfer data for English-Czech? Do we have something like that?
I have not actually achieved anything. I'm glad that a few people have approached me privately and said, "Look, because of all your work I will provide you with this amount of money."
At the other end of the spectrum, only 184 foreign residents called Marka home, and just over 700 lived in the central city district. Ullern, Vestre Aker, and Nordstrand formed the other districts with the fewest foreign residents. However, significantly more immigrants lived in these districts than in downtown Oslo and Marka. The residents from EU and EEA countries as well as the United Kingdom predominantly lived in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo, and St. Hanshaugen. While many citizens from Asia, including Turkey, also lived in Gamle Oslo (5,837), the majority were registered as residents of the Alna, Stovner, and Søndre Nordstrand districts.
On the day of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which destroyed the World Trade Center and killed 3,000 people, Trump boasted in a television interview that 40 Wall Street had suddenly become the tallest building in the city. His claim was not only insensitive, it was also a lie.
The disgraced former MP Jared O'Mara "should never have been selected as a Labour candidate" and deserved his four-year jail sentence, the deputy finance minister has said. Rachel Reeves was speaking to the Guardian in the Bolton North East constituency on Friday, hours after key figures in the local party resigned in protest at how Labour's national executive committee (NEC) was controlling the parliamentary selection process for the next general election.
This is a very short sketch of a plausible argument, that theories of capitalism that influence the actual content of science are consistent with theories that assert the existence of objective scientific facts. It is *not* an argument for the existence of objective scientific facts, in which I do not believe.

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources came to the aid of an extremely unfortunate bear after it was trapped in a culvert. According to a Facebook post by the department, the bear had crawled into a culvert beside the road near Wannaska, Minnesota. As the snow began to melt, the culvert started to fill with water, trapping the bear in deep snow and ice. Department staff responded quickly and helped free the bear. The department's bear biologist, Andrew Tri, "examined the bear and pronounced it healthy but groggy - likely from being roused from hibernation," the Facebook post said. The department then transported the bear to a state wildlife sanctuary to continue its hibernation. The drowsy carnivore was estimated to be 6 years old and weigh between 375 and 400 pounds.

Modrow, a reform-oriented communist, took over East Germany shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall and later invited opposition forces into the government, but was unable to slow down the increasing momentum towards German reunification. "The entire peaceful course of bringing about German unity was indeed his special achievement", the Left party wrote on Twitter. "That will remain his political legacy". During 16 years as head of the Communist Party in Dresden from 1973, Modrow earned a reputation as an anti-establishment politician. He rejected party privileges and insisted on living in a normal apartment.
I'm back, baby!
(PERSON8) I don't remember, so I don't remember exactly, but that's like- when I started with these multi-source experiments in the summer. The first thing I started with was concatenating the paraphrase and the source, and maybe I did, I don't remember now. I can check by the next meeting if I also tried putting the sources first, then a delimiter, and the paraphrase second. I might have also tried randomly mixing the two things, yeah, and I just remember that it did these concatenation things a lot and tried out multi-encoder.

A pedestrian has died following a collision with a car in Fife. The 38-year-old woman was taken to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy after the accident on Broad Street in Cowdenbeath at around 1:30 pm on Friday. A 24-year-old man was subsequently arrested in connection with the incident. Police are appealing for witnesses or those with dashcam footage, to come forward. Sergeant Lee Walkingshaw said: "Our enquiries are ongoing and we are asking anyone who was in the area and witnessed the incident to get in touch. I would also ask anyone who was driving in the area and may have dashcam footage that could assist our investigation to contact us. Anyone who can help is asked to call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 1638 of Friday, February 10, 2023."
Excuse me, what? My friend recommended this line's mask to me, so I bought it, this conditioner, and the all-in-one milk. I can't say anything about the effectiveness of the product because the smell was simply unbearable. You know that musty smell that old buildings use in ladies' restrooms to cover up the smell of bodily functions, but it just comes across as this sour, chemical, somehow musty grandma smell? Yeah, that's all I can think of when I smell that. To each their own, though, maybe you like the smell. My friend said it could even repair stressed hair, so if you don't mind the scent, then no worries. I know natural products don't smell as pretty as some synthetic ones, but I feel like more and more natural lines just care less since they'll sell anyway, and now everything smells like modeling clay. I've already lost a few favorite lines because they changed the formula to cheaper ingredients. I don't know if that's the case here or if it's a counterfeit (which I called Davines and they said it wasn't), but it smells like DISGUST and I had to return it.
The news that special counsel Jack Smith has subpoenaed Mike Pence raises the question: How will Trump's team use the courts to torpedo this latest development in the Justice Department's investigation? The short answer is that any attempt to thwart the Pence subpoena by invoking executive privilege should fail. First, there is the question of whether a former president can even claim the privilege at all. Recall that Trump tried and failed to prevent the Jan 6 House committee from obtaining White House documents.

The tombs of Djehuty and Hery were inaugurated on Thursday after the completion of restoration work. The inauguration was carried out by the Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Egypt, Mostafa Waziri, the Spanish Ambassador to Egypt, Alvaro Iranzo, and the President of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Eloísa del Pino. Waziri stated that the two tombs were discovered by the joint Egyptian-Spanish archaeological mission of the Supreme Council of Antiquities and CSIC, which has been working since 2002. He said that the mission carried out excavation and restoration work and published research related to the tombs which are located in the Dra Abu al-Naga area on the west bank of Luxor. They succeeded in uncovering many tombs, coffins, mummies, and a funerary garden.
Humanity launches in 5 days. It's exciting, nerve-wracking, stressful, and all the good things I love about working in the games industry. What will people think of it? I like it, but will it be able to attract an audience of the right players? Will a community form around the user-generated content part of the game? (I really hope so.) The game's story, the ideas and questions it inspires, feel current. I hope it all goes well.

How would you share private libraries?
The book was hard to follow, as it jumped around a lot. The title also didn't fit the story. The author hinted that multiple people were infected by this alien, but left out many details about when or how it happened. I was sometimes confused and had to go back a lot and reread to make sure I hadn't missed anything.
(PERSON6) For the upcoming meetings, I asked about the need because I saw the demo of the Meme project. They do offline subtitling. It's a bit simpler than what we're doing. They still have the same segmentation issues and so on. But their translation task is shortened because the data becomes shorter. And that's because their target size is the subtitles that are created for the hearing impaired. So there's a natural shortening in the data. It would be great if we could also find such data where a natural shortening takes place. We would build it into the architecture.

But after reading virtually nothing ~for decades~ (with the exception of functional, work-related non-fiction and the occasional self-help book), I set the goal of reading 23 books in 2023.
(PERSON8) I think I tried it with two tokens and yes, because in the first version we suspected that the token itself could also be tokenized, so I repeated it with a different token that is not just for this purpose, because we used a pre-trained vocabulary, and this vocabulary did not contain separators. So I used a token that I assumed would not be broken down into multiple parts and thus would only occur once. I had no guarantee that this token could not also occur in other places in the sentence and that it could only occur in this place. So it could have been done cleaner, yes, I agree with that.

Convoluted plot
It has a slimmer design form that fits better in the hands, there are no sharp edges that can catch on things, and since the power cable is firmly attached, it is far less susceptible to damage than the original XB1 controller. The disadvantages are: 1) The vibration effect triggered during action gaming feels much weaker. 2) The directional joystick and the buttons of the controller wear out very quickly. We are players with very gross motor skills and tend to wear out 2-3 controllers per year. For us, this means that we have to be selective and prudent in our annual investments in controllers. The controller could be equipped with more robust springs; after a few months, the most used buttons stop responding and the right joystick loses its centering, i.e. screens zoom in and characters run forward without even touching the controls.
Very nice guitar. Too bad the company doesn't know how to protect their product. Don't bother getting one that isn't damaged. We sent back 2 due to shipping damage, and the 3rd was also damaged. Given up, they ship it in a soft thin case with a sheet of packing paper in a box. No padding at all.

As she further explained, there is method in a strategy that most people within the Beltway would consider madness: This is the best way to gain the trust of the press. They will know that we are not whitewashing things like everyone else. SIGTARP, will quickly become the only credible source of information in Washington about TARP. We will sometimes be embarrassed and reveal things that we - and others - could easily hide, but we will shock the press with our honesty. No one else is doing this, and soon we will have a built-in defense when we are attacked. Regardless of what they hear, the press will come to us first and believe us because we will prove to them that we are telling the truth. This is perhaps the most important reason for Biden to opt for radical accountability: In every presidency, moments inevitably arise when the trust of the public and the institutions that protect the civic interest is crucial. Moreover, important capital can be gained by admitting our mistakes, and there is an important difference that Biden can draw to his political opponents. The president would do well to follow the old wisdom: Tell the truth - and shame the devil.
Forget me, ignore me, for all I care. It hurts, but you have to be yourself.
Yes, because I think it is a method that is very easy to test, and it should always be tested in contrast to the two encoders, and I would expect it to be sometimes better and sometimes worse than the two-encoder setting, depending on the exact task, like exactly what the second thing is that you're encoding. Maybe if you have two copies, two paraphrases of the same sentence, it's kind of confusing for the attention, so whatever, I don't know. The behavior might also be different for the old sequence-to-sequence models compared to the Transformer. For RNN it behaved differently, maybe with the Transformer it's yeah, it's harder to train, so maybe you have to increase the number of warm-up passes.

I can only say good things about this gift bag set. I was able to wrap all my Christmas presents with the bags, wrapping paper and tissue paper. The product is of great quality and the different size options make it easier to choose the perfect one for every gift! I highly recommend it. The seller is absolutely nice and attentive. He contacted me after my purchase to make sure I was satisfied with my product. Full 5 stars!
No, I haven't worked on it yet. [PERSON1] said that we will do it together as soon as she receives the transcript.
I really like Akkoma, the software and the domain name I got for my instance. But somehow I have the feeling that I got off to a bad start with this instance. And I never felt comfortable there. I will stay here for a little while longer and think about whether I should migrate at all.
Anyway, since this was the case here, I had to extend my viewport implementation to include the IDirect3DViewport3 methods so that the call to the new implementation was valid.
Intersexuality is even recognized by TERFs and the like, because it is generally more physical and therefore more visible. Just as mental health is seen by many as less "real" than physical health, I kind of feel that being transgender is just a form of intersexuality in the head.
Biden's Justice Department "does not want an armed citizenry"
Yes, so for multi-accent English. So, we're now putting that together with [PERSON14] as a technical solution. The current idea that [PERSON14] is working on is that he will create new sentences with words that were spoken in other sentences, and he will do this across different speakers. So it will really be multi-speaker sentences, and through that, robustness against the different accents of these speakers could also be improved. Ah, so that's a specific experiment. And later, we may do a bit more on the multi-accent aspect. So, these new sentences will actually try to solve two problems with one experiment. One problem is the implicit language model. So the ASR system needs to see the maximum number of sentences possible. And we will create new sentences from the pure text language model by adding the sound part so that the language model for the ASR gets better and the robustness against different speakers also gets better. And in a talk yesterday, I heard another idea. It was during training. They left out time bands and frequency bands from the sound. So they trained with disturbed inputs, and that also improved the robustness of the system enormously.
Just by the way, I have tried almost every "humane" trap on the market with very little success. I'm not particularly happy about killing them, but I will not accept any comments about the ethics of killing mice.
(PERSON4) And I think only two or three sentences were incorrectly inflected due to the wrong context, so the translation was wrong. And then, there are some cases where the translation was completely wrong because the sentence was entirely incorrect and the part must have been incomprehensible, but that only happened in one or two cases.
This is important. Please write this <incomprehensible/> summary here in the documenter, because it is for [PERSON2]. And also [PERSON2], when you speak to [PERSON10], and possibly [PERSON5] as well. If we have this tool, we will need to (send) the audio to multiple ASRs or multiple employees <incomprehensible/>. We will need to (send) the audio separately to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR and the Czech ASR, for example, depending on <background noise/>. And also to this speech recognition engine, and then we need to merge these outputs, and that's a tool we don't have yet. This is the multi-source tool that will observe the text outputs and also follow the timestamps, and it would emit the output into three separate language channels by using either silence or the correct ASR. So we need a filter for the ASRs, so that the ASR is silent when it's the wrong language, and it's the recognized text when it's the right language. I just conceptualized this kind of setup. Another possibility would be that the same sound is sent to the ASR and this language checker. This language checker is essentially part of the ASR and mutes the ASR when it's the wrong language. That's also an option. So we need to figure out which kind of integration of the language ID is best suited for our purposes. So please keep thinking about what our pipelines look like. Ideally, I think the least confusion would arise in management and so on if our MT models were multilingual. If they would support different source languages and translate from any of those languages into English. They might just make a copy if English was given as input, so we'd have multilingual ASRs at the beginning. Everything will go into English, and then from English into all languages. And later, if [PERSON12] had a multilingual ASR model, the language ID wouldn't even be necessary anymore.
Oh well, one of them was for me yesterday.

The eight-eyed Repnids seem to watch as you set the glider down on the red soil, but they make no move to approach you; in fact, they are motionless as you climb out of the glider and slowly walk towards them. The ground beneath your feet begins to tremble and then shake, as if in an earthquake, and you lose your footing, although the Repnids seem unimpressed. The rock beneath you suddenly gives way. The Repnids' tunnels have been dug beneath the surface and you fall into a seething mass of hundreds of Repnid bodies in a cave below. The end is quick, as several pairs of venomous fangs inject their deadly poison and the air of Dyskra contaminates your lungs. No one will ever know that you were the first human time traveler.
The more I read studies on biological sex, gender identity, and psychology, the more I find the statement "My biological sex is male, my gender identity is female" to be simplistic and inaccurate. It almost seems as if one is ceding part of the argument to TERFs. I think that being trans means being "biologically non-binary". My biological sex is non-binary, my gender identity is female.
Antonio Conte has complained about the defense and this player is currently having problems defending. He's playing against very good players like Barnes and Maddison, but it's very disappointing. While the goal was disallowed, Leicester restored the 4-1 lead with Barnes nine minutes before the end of the game. Despite the win against Manchester City last week, Tottenham missed the chance to overtake Newcastle and take third place.
I've been toying with this idea for a while:

I asked the seller before purchasing if the color was too yellow, and I was told it was more like antique gold - darker. Not at all! The set looks VERY cheap. It is super shiny yellow with lots of zirconia stones, even shinier. It looks great in the photo. But in real life, I wouldn't even give it to a teenager to wear.
Nevertheless, unimaginable fear, terror, and expulsion have left them with the invisible scar of trauma.
The battery life on the one I bought from Amazon is terrible. I still can't believe Logitech discontinued this remote, nothing else comes close to comparing. I absolutely love this Harmony remote, this is my 4th one. The dog chewed up the first one, my husband knelt on the screen of the second one, and the third one still works, but there's also an elbow mark in the middle of the touchscreen, also thanks to my husband... I bought this one as a replacement and the screen is great, but the included battery lasts maybe a few days. My original (the 3rd one) holds a charge for weeks, and I use my remote for everything.

With 28,020 people living in Oslo, Africans formed the third-largest immigrant group in Oslo. Europeans from countries outside the United Kingdom, the EU, or the EEA were the fourth-largest group and made up 15,566 Oslo residents. From here, the size of the groups decreases significantly. For example, in 2022, there were just under 7,000 citizens from South American countries, while there were slightly over 3,000 nationals from North and Central America. Meanwhile, there were fewer than 700 people from Oceania in Oslo.
I bought these in February. Recently, I tried to use them, and, unfortunately, every time I try one, my Keurig machine gives me an error message that the pod is not compatible with my machine. I have been using Donut Shop pods in my machine since I first bought it and never had a problem. Upon closer inspection of the coffee pod, I noticed that the code printed on the top of the pod is not very legible, so I can only assume that I received a defective box. I bought a box of 72, which is 6 boxes of 12 each. I even tried one from each of the 6 boxes and always get the same error message. I know it's not my machine because other pods I try work perfectly fine. It's just this shipment that I'm having this problem with. Very disappointing as my return window has expired. UPDATE: I spoke with a customer rep who refunded my money. Thank you AMAZON for your wonderful customer support!

Adriana Kuch, 14, was found dead in her home in Bayville on February 3, two days after the disturbing video of the attack at Central Regional High School was posted online. The video showed girls throwing a drink on the teenager, then kicking her and dragging her through the school hallways. They slammed Adriana against red lockers lining the school corridors, and one of the girls in a pink shirt repeatedly hit her.
I'm giving it 3 stars at present, I don't want to leave a bad review for the seller unless they deserve it, but this drone overheats very often. I'm not sure if I should contact the seller or DJI Tello itself, but I'll probably try both just to see what they say. I like the drone. It's a cool little toy that flies better than some bigger, older drones and some of my bigger drones feel more like a toy than this one. However, it's the only drone I've ever had overheating issues with. It actually takes the fun out of flying. For now, I'm going to assume it's a manufacturing issue that they need to address as soon as possible if they want their product to be successful. I really hope the seller didn't send me a used drone, as I paid for a new one. I have to give the seller credit for the delivery, as it arrived 1 day after purchase. I will update my review after contacting the seller and DJI Tello.
White nationalists, gun nuts, right-wing dictatorship supporters... that's where the danger lies. Deport the white racists.
Later in life, Modrow was active in the Council of Elders of the Left Party. "Hans was a deeply sincere and combative socialist," Dietmar Bartsch, the chairman of the Left Party's parliamentary group, tweeted. "Until an advanced age, he was an important advisor in our party, whose wisdom we will miss."
(PERSON10) Yes, I think - didn't Dominik do some experiments with Ivana a year or two ago on double empty, where they took the context into account or concatenated the context with the input sentence and did some kind of document-level translation? But the thing with concatenation is that you can't be quite sure if it has the same effect when we use multiple encoders.
"Great importance is attached to the development of sports infrastructure. Clear evidence of this is this athletics complex with over six thousand seats," the letter from the Kazakh President states. Kazakh athletes successfully participate in major international competitions and represent Kazakhstan. They are a role model for the younger generation and inspire young people to achieve great victories, said Tokayev. He expressed confidence that hosting the Asian Championships in Astana will provide a new impetus to the development of athletics in the country and pledged stronger cooperation with international organizations in this area.

(PERSON2) My idea is that a client clicks on this microphone button and starts speaking, and while the user is speaking, the system should simultaneously send the audio in small chunks. Let's say 200 or even 100 milliseconds. And pass it into a queue on the HTTP server, which I will later process with (ASR). And the model will perform some logic, inference with it. And whenever a new piece of the transcript is available, it will be sent back, and the user should get the partial transcript back. And it should be displayed immediately in the text field.
Yes, yes, it is indeed very important to parallelize everything, both the processing of the systems and the evaluation of the cell data frame, because one has to do this many times, there will be errors, and you have to be able to do this again quickly.
(PERSON4) Yes, thank you.

In Numbers: The Oslo Districts with the Most International Residents
Porcupine with amethyst and magenta spines. It is average in size, has an average build, and is muscular. Its tail is extremely thick. Its hair is raspberry-colored, short, and curly. Its eyes are almond-shaped, and it wears scarlet cat-eye glasses. Its most interesting feature is its good deeds.
"I've played around a bit with Flutter. To be honest, I'd rather not build my business on technology from Google, but on the other hand, Google is one of the few major providers with real incentives to create a compelling cross-platform experience, and that's also evident."
Abe hides his sorrow and laughs quickly, while Tom isn't afraid to cry but is less amused by crude humor. Jan will hurt you before letting you see that she is hurt and laughs the most when everything is in chaos. Mio knows that sorrow is a constant part of life.
I was disappointed when I received this item because the silver part that goes around the face seemed to be made of some kind of cheap plastic. It wasn't so much the fact that it was made of plastic that disappointed me, but rather the fact that the plastic used made it look incredibly cheap. For me, this detail ruined the entire look. I also didn't trust that it would withstand daily use, so I ended up returning it. I was disappointed because it would have seemed like a good deal if it wasn't for that. However, if you can look past that, it might be right for you. It was well packaged and arrived quickly.
I'm tired of Conservative parties and governments presenting themselves as business-friendly. They are not, at least not in Alberta.
Tim Sherwood criticizes £44 million new signing Pedro Porro after miserable Tottenham debut
You land the aircraft nose-up on the side of the slag heap and get out. The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching, but they make no move towards you. In fact, they remain motionless as you slowly approach them. You stop while still standing on the mound of shattered rock and earth, and speak to them: "I come in peace, as a friend." They do not seem to be able to hear you, let alone understand you, as your universal translator receives no response. You decide to use your psychic perception to mentally contact them. You find it difficult to comprehend their thoughts; they are disturbingly alien and your mind recoils from the contact. You decide that it would be dangerous to make contact again, and return to your aircraft, but the experience has cleared your mind, which has been confused since you jumped into the future. Back in the Falcon's Wing, you find it quite easy to plot a course for Earth in the year 3034 AD. Note that you have used up another polybdenum rod when jumping.
For text flow, we use something like Hypercore, but I'm not sure if that would work for this.
A recently graduated artist did not take criticism well tonight, partly because he had been poorly trained. But, it's important not to look for excuses for problems, but simply to fix them, especially in production when the supervisor needs changes, particularly with the competition.
I bought this lamp to supplement the light my new vegetable seedlings were getting from the window. I love many of the features of these lights. Advantages: First, they easily clip onto my shelving unit and can be bent into many positions so I can make adjustments as my plants grow. The lights are cool to the touch and have not caused any damage even when touching the plants. I believe my vegetables have benefited from the lights. The lights are dimmable, but I only use the strongest setting. I haven't used the timer because I prefer to turn them on and off myself. I can imagine this feature being useful in an office environment with houseplants or while on vacation. Disadvantages: I don't think these lights are strong enough to be the main light source for seedlings. The lights are quite small. If the lights burn out, I have to buy a whole new unit.
I want these companies that broker transactions to explain to their customers how they set their percentages. They won't talk about that at Bloomberg. But if Spotify has a good quarter, they will do it.

(PERSON1) Yes, I think he told us at the beginning of the semester that we can get an A if we want an A. We just have to submit it within the second deadline. That's pretty much the only thing he asked for. But he also told us that judging by the trends of previous years, many people don't do that. They find it easier to study for the exam. No, sorry, to study for the exam ...

Kazakh Prime Minister Smailov expressed his special gratitude to the President of the Asian Athletics Association, Dahlan al-Hamad, for his support in preparing and holding the championships. The Asian Indoor Athletics Championships are being held for the first time in the territory of the CIS. The tournament brings together over 500 athletes from 31 countries competing in the disciplines of running, relay, long jump, high jump, triple jump, pole vault, shot put, and combined events. The tournament runs until February 12. It was previously reported that, Kazakh runner Caroline Chepkoech Kipkirui won gold in the women's 3,000 m at the tournament and Olga Safronova took silver in the women's 60 m.

Remote work opens up new possibilities. It allows people to work in comfortable spaces instead of stuffy, noisy offices. It makes work accessible to anyone with an internet connection and a suitable workspace. It enables people to avoid long commute times that take away from their day and their families.
I have never said that before.
(PERSON4) It's just that the dilemma score for (European?) is not included in the table because the table doesn't fit in the paper, so <incomprehensible/>. The coverage is always 97 percent. It simply generates the correct lemmata, only the dilemma score is missing.
I had the good fortune of spending six unforgettable months with Nicholas in 2011 and supporting a number of projects. When we met at the weekend, I was delighted to hear about the progress, especially with the tree planting and support for farms. Thousands of trees have been planted and the farmers' crop yields have been increased through a range of measures, from support with purchasing equipment to training.
This is a very beautiful skirt. The lace pattern is stylish and soft. It doesn't wrinkle, even after being stuffed in plastic and a box, it was very smooth, which is really cool. It can easily be worn casually or dressy and has a vintage feel due to its length and cut, which I really like. I think it could flatter anyone. I'm 1.65 m tall, weigh 59 kg and ordered Small, so I would say if you feel like you're wavering between Small and Medium, you should definitely go for a size smaller.
President's Cup: Candystripes defeat Rovers in season opener at Brandywell Stadium
Yes, I was just thinking about what kinds of data we are currently using for this, because if you check, for example, the models of [ORGANIZATION4] on [ORGANIZATION5], they are already pretty good at these things.
A 16-year-old boy was charged with murder for the fatal shooting of two students at a Chicago high school in December, police announced Friday. The suspect is charged with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder, Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown announced. "We currently have no clear motive as to why a 16-year-old would want to shoot and kill other children," Brown said. The suspect's name was not released Friday due to his age, although Brown said he will be held accountable as an adult for murder and attempted murder.
The figures from Statistics Norway showed that foreigners were spread across all districts of the city, with over 14,000 immigrants registered in Søndre Nordstrand, the southernmost district of Oslo. Many immigrants also lived in sought-after areas, as Frogner was the district with the fifth-highest number of foreigners. Moreover, Stovner, Bjerke, Grorud, Østensjø and Sagene were among the remaining ten districts in Oslo with the most residents from another country.

And that, although I haven't slept as well here in the last two nights as I do at home and am a little weakened by #MECFS by being in an unfamiliar environment where I can't organize myself as well and have to remember where things are.
The owner of the Russian Wagner Group, a private military company actively involved in the fighting in Ukraine, has predicted that the war could drag on for years. Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video interview released late on Friday, that it could take 18 months to two years for Russia to gain full control of Ukraine's eastern industrial region, the Donbas. He added that the war could last three years if Moscow decides to capture larger territories east of the Dnieper River.
(PERSON6) And I think if we just - We could probably just get the data from them, because [ORGANIZATION5] basically has such a large amount of videos with different topics and different native speakers. I had the idea that we could just use a tool to basically download a set of filtered videos from [ORGANIZATION5] and create a training dataset from that.
I'm now on book no. 31 and it's only May.
Thank you to everyone who has downloaded the latest update for Leasey. We've encountered a few very small issues. Nothing alarming, but they will be fixed nonetheless. Next week, a small update will be created to correct these. We spent much of yesterday installing the new update for some customers. Anyone who needed this support should have received it by now. Have a good day!
Well, I understand that in practice, IDirectXObject2 is typically a true superset of IDirectXObject, without altered function signatures and new methods that are only added at the end. But this is not universally valid; in such cases, it is important which interface you use to create the object in question.
Photos: After restorations, Egypt inaugurates the tombs of Djehuty and Hery
GAZIANTEP.KAZINFORM - Kazakh rescue workers continue to search the rubble for survivors in Turkey, Kazinform reports, citing the press service of the Kazakh Ministry of Emergency Situations. The work of the rescuers is hampered by large amounts of debris and unstable structures. So far, the Kazakh rescue team in Turkey has recovered seven earthquake survivors and the bodies of 19 people, including a child. First aid is also being provided around the clock. Notably, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 struck parts of southeastern Turkey and northern Syria early Monday, causing devastation. To date, the death toll from massive earthquakes in southeastern Turkey has risen to over 20,000.
In our daily lives, we are constantly looking for ways to boost our energy and avoid exhaustion, especially in our careers. This can be extremely difficult for people in healthcare. That's why I asked 30 health and wellness experts the same question: "How do you manage your energy and avoid burnout in your profession?" Their fields range from infectious disease specialists to psychologists to mindfulness teachers - and they all had great advice on how to stay motivated and keep the ball rolling. Despite the vast differences in their roles, there were several themes in their responses that emerged as ways to avoid exhaustion.
Russia suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in the fall as the Ukrainian army launched successful counteroffensives to reclaim large areas in the east and south. The Kremlin has avoided making predictions about how long the fighting could last, stating that what it calls a "special military operation" will continue until its goals are achieved. Russian forces have focused on the Ukrainian provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk, which make up the Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014.
I had bleached my entire head a few months ago and then dyed it over with a black box dye. After that, I had highlights done all over my head. A few weeks later, I applied blue/green Arctic Fox hair dye to my hair, and it wouldn't fade. I used the product with Olaplex No. 3 and it lightened strongly everywhere, removed the green and blue parts, and lifted the dark box dye. However, after one day, I noticed a green tint in my hair. Every day it's getting worse and I've already used the color remover twice, with the same result. My hair is also getting darker where the box dye was. This is a great product, but it doesn't seem to last long.
One person was arrested during a protest outside the Tate Britain, where a storytelling event featuring a drag queen for children was taking place. The Metropolitan Police said, one person was arrested on suspicion of making a racially aggravated comment to a police officer outside the art gallery near Westminster. No injuries were reported and officers remain at the scene, police said.

And then I agree that there is a lot of noise in this dictionary. So I asked that you create different versions of this dictionary by only taking the words that were observed five times or more. And only the pronunciations that were observed three times or more, or something like that. This way, these random errors, like the example with this "for" IBM instead of IBM, will not occur as often. But still, you will have the pronunciation variants, because if the person says this "alzo" when you remember, if they say this "alzo" with a "Z" 20 times in the conversation, then you will see that in the data with the "Z". And if they sometimes manage to say it correctly, then you will see that again in the data as well. So I want [PERSON4] to stay in touch with [PERSON2]. Maybe you stay in conversation, right? I have to go now because I have to make lunch for the kids and so on. But please stay in this conversation and figure out together how to use this dictionary. So [PERSON4], please show [PERSON2] which dictionary the system accepts. Share your screen and show it to him. And [PERSON2], please look at that and help convert the dictionary you output into this file. One thing that is still needed is the language model substitute. But all these words should be known words. So [PERSON4], you need to figure out which words are included in the language model. And the words that are included in the language model should just be copied. So the dictionary will have three columns. The grapheme, as it is output. Recognized once. The phonemes, as suggested by [PERSON2]. And there will be multiple lines with different phoneme variations. And the third column will also be the same for all of these again, and there again will be the same grapheme form. This is what it looks like when the language model sees it. And I think this way these systems should be able to load it. And you may face another problem: The system may not be ready for two large custom dictionaries. So that also needs to be tested, but please test it together. [PERSON2] knows what he created in the dictionary. And you know what the dictionary looks like when you create it manually, and you need to put these two pieces of knowledge together. Ah, to make it work with the generated dictionary.

Every artist has been there, made the same mistakes. Good criticism is there to quickly correct the problem and is not directed against your skills. It assumes that you are able to fix the problem or find a solution.
<incomprehensible/> that you like can improve your translation quality score by simply appending phrase-based output, and the attention mechanism is like a two-way diagonal, so attention is not an issue. I believe you, but it's surprising that it didn't work.
And so I suddenly had to organize a raid group composition.

3 1/2 stars - "Remedy" is a mix of a love story about the brother's best friend and a second chance romance. It's a unique story and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to win Collins back and prove that he's the right one for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had a wonderful night together. Collins thought she would finally get everything she had dreamed of: her brother's best friend. But when she woke up alone the next morning and never heard from him again, the situation definitely changed. Now Grady is back, he's not going away, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left and that he won't give up on her this time. Although I loved the premise of this story and Grady at times, he really got on my nerves. I understand his reasons for leaving that night, but not even sending a letter to Collins to explain himself? Leaving her in the dark and hurt for all those years and then expecting her to welcome him with open arms? Was he delusional? Collins was right to be upset, angry, and hurt. She was right to fight him when he wanted her back and wanted to move forward. I admire her willpower because Grady was persistent. I liked Collins in this book, she was strong and protected her heart. I admired her for that. Sure, she loved Grady, but she was scared and hesitant to let him back into her life. Who wouldn't be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite of the two. She let things happen at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There's a lot of angst in this book and I enjoyed watching these two come back together as Collins started to forgive Grady. I just wish Grady hadn't come across as so whiny and had been a little more understanding. He kept saying he would understand, but sometimes he was a little too pushy for me. Towards the end, he was sweet. I liked him just as much as Collins by the end, but at the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his point of view because I couldn't connect with his character. The first part of this book was not my favorite, but I adored the second part, hence my rating. If you like second chance and brother's best friend stories, you might really enjoy this book. I just had a hard time with Grady initially and how he handled some things he did.
But did I love it? Absolutely!
Derry City emerged victorious in the President's Cup by defeating Shamrock Rovers 2:0. The FAI Cup winners beat last year's champions at the Brandywell thanks to goals from Will Patching and Michael Duffy in the first half. The Hoops pushed for a goal in the second half, but Ruaidhri Higgins' team held firm and won the season opener. Derry travels to St. Patrick's Athletic for the league opener next Friday. After 23 minutes, Patching's instep shot put Derry in the lead - the midfielder scored the first goal when the Foylesiders, won 2:1 against the eventual champions in February.
There was particular dissatisfaction that Leigh Drennan, the chair of Labour North West and an aide to the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting MP for Warrington North, Charlotte Nichols, was not longlisted to win back the seat from the Conservatives, despite having garnered nominations from four major unions. Reeves said, she had nothing to do with the selection of candidates, but added: "I know it's really important that we have rigorous procedures in place for who can be longlisted, and who can be shortlisted."
In recent years, certain Hindu hardliners have raided stores selling Valentine's Day items, burned cards and gifts, and chased hand-holding couples out of restaurants and parks, insisting that the day violates traditional values and promotes promiscuity. Hindu nationalist groups like Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal have said that such raids help restore a Hindu identity. Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi say his government has pushed a Hindu agenda and sought the primacy of the religion in a secular state known for its diversity. While Hindus make up nearly 80% of the nearly 1.4 billion people, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains make up most of the rest.
The dislike of literature courses is even worse: I love to read. I had read most of the classics before I turned eighteen - although that's more a reflection of living in the middle of nowhere, I also read the 1979 Encyclopedia Britannica out of desperation.

In July 2022, California officials charged Kilcher with two counts of grave workers' compensation fraud. They accused her of illegally receiving more than $96,000 in workers' compensation benefits between October 2019 and September 2021. The period also includes several months during which Kilcher worked on "Yellowstone," despite claiming she was too injured to work. Kilcher turned herself in to authorities in May and was charged.

Avoid Wi-Fi connections - use Bluetooth! I bought this scale in October 2017 for my wife. At that time, we were in the middle of a move and living in a hotel. I couldn't connect the scale to the hotel's Wi-Fi. I decided to wait until we moved into our house and I could set up my own Wi-Fi system. March 2018 - I set up my Wi-Fi system and the scale still won't connect. Every time I try, I get an error message. Even when I'm only about 3 meters away from the Wi-Fi device. I followed the instructions in the YouTube video, but without success. When I bought the device, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like with Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wi-Fi router to communicate with the phone. This system is limited to the connection to the router ... which is usually not near the bedroom, unlike a phone! I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone due to the Wi-Fi connection. Instead, look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I will replace this with a Bluetooth-connected scale.
(PERSON1) and then we will figure out which packages we need to install in the Petri environment.
Wazir explained that these two tombs belong to important people who lived at the beginning of the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom, one of the most important eras of ancient Egypt. He said that the layout of the tombs is T-shaped, a style frequently used in tombs from the 18th Dynasty. These consist of an entrance, a columned hall leading to a burial shaft, and walls with characteristic inscriptions. Waziri added that Djehuty was an overseer of the state treasury and supervised the work of craftsmen and artists during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut.

The circumstances surrounding O'Mara had been "quite extraordinary", Reeves said, but she admitted: "There are important lessons that the Labour Party and all political parties need to learn in selecting candidates. But I would also say that in this parliament we have seen the constant undermining of standards in politics, not least by a series of prime ministers and fines and parties and standards that fall far short of what one would expect." She added: "One thing I would say about the Labour Party is that when people do something wrong, they lose party discipline. This is simply not the case with the Conservatives."
So this is an important thing that we should have addressed months ago. Remember that I've been telling you since August that we want to evaluate on a later test dataset. And every time, you all thought... It's not just about you personally, [PERSON8]. Of course, there were other things too. But every time you thought about it, you thought, "This will be easy, we'll just run it." And only when you actually do it, you see all the problems. So, that's known, common. It's always like that. So this is a message for everyone. Until you try it, you never know what the problem will be. For example, when I had the conversation where someone was interviewing me, they wanted to record the video. Zoom has never worked so badly for me as it did today during the recording. So, before you do it, you can't say whether it will work or not. And here we run into the problems with converting the file formats. So, hopefully, we will be able to get the numbers quickly. So do you already have any word error rates?
I found out the hard way that local TV station websites in 2023 are the absolute worst experience on the Internet. Pop-ups, auto-playing videos, animations, overlays and ads, ads, ads. I know ads are their revenue source, but all this crap seems counterproductive if it drives people away. This still holds true even now that Goatse.cx no longer exists, although it would be a neck-and-neck race between Goatse and, for instance, KHOU.com, where I was trying to watch a video Wendy had sent me.
(PERSON3) I think that's actually an interesting question, whether we can use the conditions to enforce the speaker's gender in the translation.
Jami slipped him the note as they passed each other in passing, shortly before the dog watch. She was on her way to the wall; he had just finished his shift. He looked back to watch her leave and to make sure they hadn't been seen. She didn't look back. He waited until he was in the darkness of the dormitory before pulling out the note and reading it in a beam of light that was penetrating the blackout curtains. One word in block letters. He stared at it for a long time, trying to stay calm:
One of the fans sounded unbalanced from the start. The speed controllers don't work properly - when you set them to 100%, the fans turn off, so you have to set them to 100% and then slowly turn them back until they turn on again. The build quality is mediocre, but this seems to be normal for most products of this type in this price range. The feet that tilt the laptop up have broken off a few times... They can be plugged back in, but it happens often enough to be annoying. On the positive side, the fans are ideally placed for laptops that draw in air through vents near the top of the laptop. Many other coolers have fans in the middle and provide very little additional airflow for laptops with this type of cooling design.
Yes, when the context is short and because I make decisions based on very short contexts for this very low latency, then it really chooses something that it finds out after one or two seconds, for example, oh, that was actually a bad translation. So it tries to use a different wording to specify the thing, for example. So in fact, I really liked it. I like some of the translations. I was really amazed; even though you could see that the model made mistakes on its first attempt, it really wanted to make some kind of correction. And it definitely sounded really fluent, which I think is important too. If you really demand low latency, then I think even a slightly lower quality is okay if the fluency is good. Because if you have poor translation quality and poor fluency, then I think the translation is just meaningless. But if the lower quality is due to the translation using more words, for example, and some corrections and so on, when you read everything, you get the same information, but the wording is just bad. So I think this is totally fine for simultaneous translations, as long as you don't lose any information. And for which language pairs do you have these results, like some examples? Because I'd like to take a look, just out of curiosity.

It's strange to do weightlifting but have no real idea what your one-rep maximum is, because that's one of the most important ways people track their progress. I train alone in my bedroom without a spotter or even a rack. Just me and a barbell with a bunch of weights. I do bench press on my bed. If I try to find out what my one-rep maximum is, I might not own enough weights to reach my max, or conversely, it could seriously injure/kill me. Anyway, the load is being increased today. Still feels good.

The incident occurred after an increase in the number of refugees and asylum seekers crossing the English Channel in boats to Great Britain. Police have arrested 15 people after an anti-refugee demonstration outside a hotel used to house asylum seekers near the English city of Liverpool turned violent. Merseyside Police said one police officer and two civilians were slightly injured in the unrest on Friday evening in Knowsley. Police said, some demonstrators threw objects and set a police car on fire. Those arrested, aged 13 to 54, were detained "following violent disorder." Merseyside's Police Commissioner, Emily Spurrell, told Radio City: "It was incredibly dangerous and there were some injuries to police officers."
