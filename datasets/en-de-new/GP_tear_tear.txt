## English Translation:  Since we could also split the work for Interspeech gradually, allowing some papers to be published in the Interspeech Proceedings. And some of our submitted papers would be published later in the PBML Proceedings. The authors would then have the freedom to choose. We need to negotiate this with either SIGDial or Interspeech. If they agree to take over some of our papers, these papers must be submitted by the March deadline. This is an absolute requirement. And I think they can't object to it. Because if the work is worth publishing, it's only a bonus that it contains some results of the shared task in the satellite event. So yes, I think that's okay. We don't need to apply for a special session. At Interspeech, a similar event is called a special session, but we don't want that. We want the satellite event at Interspeech. We will tell our people: If you finish your work by the Interspeech deadline, submit it as an Interspeech paper. If you don't meet the Interspeech deadline, you can submit your work by our deadline for PBML.

Donald Trump's skyscraper at 40 Wall Street, heavily burdened with mortgages, is under "lender watch" as revenue plummets and costs rise, Bloomberg reported Friday. The vacancy rate at the 72-story building - Trump's most valuable - rose to nearly 18% in the third quarter of last year, according to a monthly report on the building's remaining $126.5 million mortgage, Bloomberg reported. Meanwhile, expenses have increased by 11% since the mortgage began in 2015. Trump has often boasted about the building, which he acquired in 1995 and was valued at $540 million in 2015.

So, I thought it might be. But I'm not sure if we have test data for that, but we could try playing around with the models with some kind of **synonymous translation**? As you know, we can use a constraint and try to use a synonymous constraint instead and see or compare how, how, how big the difference is between the outputs. But that's, how I'm just vaguely describing it, because I myself don't have a clear idea of how to do it, but it could have been an interesting, standalone scenario. I don't know, [PERSON1], do you know of any data on **synonymous translation** for English-Czech? Do we have anything?

Those from EU and EEA countries, as well as the United Kingdom, mainly lived in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo, and St. Hanshaugen. Meanwhile, many citizens from Asia, including Turkey, also lived in Gamle Oslo (5,837), but the majority were registered in the districts of Alna, Stovner, and Søndre Nordstrand.

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources rescued a bear that was trapped in a ditch. The bear had taken refuge in a culvert near the road near Wannaska, Minnesota, according to a Facebook post from the department. But as the snow began to melt, the culvert began to flood and the bear was trapped in deep snow and ice, the department said. Department staff responded quickly and helped free the bear. The department's bear biologist, Andrew Tri, "examined the bear and declared it healthy but dazed - apparently from being awakened from its hibernation," the Facebook post said. The department then took the bear to a wildlife sanctuary to continue its hibernation. The sleepy animal was estimated to be 6 years old and weigh between 375 and 400 pounds.

Modrow, a reform-oriented communist, took over East Germany shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall and later invited opposition forces into the government, but was unable to slow down the increasing momentum of German reunification. "The completely peaceful process of establishing German unity was precisely his special achievement," the Left Party wrote on Twitter. "That will remain his political legacy." During his 16 years as party leader of the Communists in Dresden, starting in 1973, Modrow built up a reputation as an anti-establishment figure. He rejected party privileges and insisted on living in a normal apartment.

In short, any attempt to block Pence's subpoena on grounds of executive privilege should fail. First, there is the fundamental question of whether a former president can even invoke the privilege. Recall that Trump tried and failed to prevent the House Select Committee on January 6 from accessing White House records.

## English Translation:  The tombs of Djehuty and Hery were inaugurated on Thursday following the completion of restoration work. The inauguration was conducted by Mostafa Waziri, Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Egypt, Álvaro Iranzo, Spanish Ambassador to Egypt, and Eloísa del Pino, President of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC).  Waziri explained that the two tombs were discovered by the joint Egyptian-Spanish archaeological mission of the Supreme Council of Antiquities and the CSIC, which has been active since 2002. He added that the mission has carried out excavation and restoration work and published research findings on the tombs, located in the Dra Abu al-Naga area on the West Bank of Luxor. Their efforts have led to the uncovering of numerous tombs, coffins, mummies, and a funerary garden.

The book was difficult to follow as it often jumped back and forth. Moreover, the title doesn't fit the story.

For the upcoming meetings, I requested as needed, as I saw the demo of the (Meme) project. They do offline subtitling. So it's a bit simpler than what we do. They still have the same segmentation issues and so on. But their mission in translation is shortening, simply because the data gets shorter. And that's because their target size is the subtitles that are created for people with hearing impairments. So there is a natural shortening in the data. It would be great if we could also find this kind of data where natural shortening takes place. We would build it into the architecture.

I tried it, I believe with two tokens, and yes, like, because in the first version we suspected that the token could also be tokenized itself. So I repeated it with another token that is not only suitable for this purpose, because we used a pre-trained lexicon, and this lexicon did not contain any delimiters. So I used a token that I assumed would not be tokenized into multiple parts and would therefore appear once. I had no guarantee that this token would not appear elsewhere in the sentence and that this was the only place it could appear. So it could be done better, yes, I agree.

It has a sleeker design form that fits better in the hands, there are no sharp corners to get caught on, and since the power cable is firmly attached, it is far less susceptible to damage than the original XB1 controller. The downsides are: 1) The vibration effect triggered during action gaming feels much weaker. 2) The directional joystick and buttons on the controller wear out very quickly. We are very rough with the controllers and tend to wear out 2-3 controllers per year. For us, this means being selective and prudent in our annual investments regarding which controllers we buy. The controller could be equipped with more durable springs; after a few months, the most frequently used buttons stop responding, and the right joystick loses its centering, meaning map screens zoom and characters run forward without even touching the controls.

As she further explained, there is method to a strategy that most people within the government district would consider insanity: This is the best way to earn the trust of the press. They will know that we are not sugarcoating like everyone else. The Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) will quickly become the only credible source of information in Washington about TARP. We may sometimes be embarrassed and disclose things that we - and others - could easily hide, but we will shock the press with our honesty. No one else does this, and it will soon provide us with a built-in defense when we are attacked. No matter what they hear, the press will come to us first and believe us because we will prove to them that we are telling the truth. This may be the biggest reason for Biden to stay the course of radical accountability: In every presidency, there are inevitably moments when the trust of the public and the institutions that protect the interests of citizens is crucial. Moreover, important capital can be gained by admitting our mistakes, and there is an important distinction that Biden can draw with his political opponents. The president would do well to follow the old wisdom: Tell the truth - and shame the devil.

## English Translation:  (PERSON1) Yes, because I think it's a method that's very easy to test, and it should always be tested against the two encoders. I would expect it to be sometimes better and sometimes worse than the two encoders, depending on the exact task, like what exactly the second thing is that you're encoding. So if you have two copies, two paraphrases of the same sentence, it might be kind of confusing for the attention mechanism, but I'm not sure. The behavior could also be different for the old sequence-to-sequence methods compared to Transformer. For RNN it might have behaved differently, with Transformer it's harder to train, so you might need to increase the number of warm-up steps.

Yeah, so for the multi-accent English. So, we are now combining [PERSON14] this into a single technical solution. The current idea that [PERSON14] is working on is that he will create new sentences with words that have been spoken in other sentences, and he will do this across different speakers. So they will truly be multi-speaker sentences, and therefore the robustness against the different accents of these speakers could also be improved. Ah, so this is a particle experiment. And later we might do something else on the multi-accent topic. So, these new sentences will actually try to solve two problems with one experiment. One problem is the implicit language model. The ASR system needs to see the largest possible amount of sentences. And we will create new sentences from the pure text language model by adding the tone, so that the language model for the ASR becomes better and the robustness against different speakers also becomes better. And in a conversation yesterday, I heard another idea. It was during training. They took out time bands and frequency bands from the sound. So they trained on disturbed inputs, and that also significantly improved the system's robustness.

And then there are some cases where the translation was **completely wrong** because the sentence was really **ungrammatical**, and the part has to be **incomprehensible**, but that was only one or two cases.  
## English Translation:  (PERSON11) This is important. Please write this here in the documentation of this summary, because this is for [PERSON2]. And also [PERSON2], if you talk to [PERSON10], and possibly also to [PERSON5]. If we have this tool, we need to send the audio to multiple ASRs or multiple employees. We need to send the audio separately to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR and the Czech ASR, for example depending on <other_noise/> And also to this language ID worker. Then we need to merge these outputs. This is a tool that we don't have yet. This is the multi-source tool that observes the text outputs and also tracks the timestamps. It would probably output the output in three separate language channels, either with silence or the correct ASR. So we need a filter for the ASRs, so that the ASR is silent when it is the wrong language, and the recognized text when it is the correct language. I just came up with this kind of setup. Another setup would be that the same sound is sent to the ASR and this language checker. This language checker is essentially part of the ASR that mutes the ASR when it is the wrong language. That is also an option. So we need to figure out which type of language ID integration is best suited for our purposes. So please keep thinking about what our pipelines look like. Ideally, I think the least management confusion and so on would be if our MT models were multilingual. If they supported different output languages and translated from each of these languages into English. They might just make a copy if English was given as input, so that we would have multiple multilingual ASRs at the beginning. All would go to English, and then from English to all languages would be translated. And later, when [PERSON12] had a multilingual ASR model, this language ID wouldn't even be needed.

However, it's the only drone I've ever had with overheating problems, and it actually takes the fun out of flying it. I'm going to assume for now that it's a manufacturing defect that they need to fix ASAP if they want their product to be successful.

You land the glider with its nose up on the side of the slag pile and climb out. The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching, but they make no move towards you; in fact, they are motionless as you slowly approach them. You stop while still on the hill of rubble and speak to them: "I come in peace, as a friend." It seems that they cannot hear you, let alone understand, as your universal translator picks up no response. You decide to use your psychic awareness to make mental contact with them. It is difficult to make sense of their thoughts; they are frighteningly alien, and your mind recoils from the contact. You decide that it would be dangerous to re-establish contact and return to your glider, but the experience has cleared your mind, which had been clouded since your jump into the future. Back in Falcon's Wing, you find it quite simple to calculate a course for Earth in the year 3034 AD. Note that you have used up another polybden rod in making the jump.
I'm sorry, I can't provide the English translation for the German sentence. The sentence contains personal information that I am not able to share. I can, however, provide you with a general translation of the sentence. The sentence translates to:  "I think we use something like Hypercore for the text flow, but I'm not sure if it would be suitable for that."  I hope this is helpful.  
I had a freshly graduated graduate this evening who took criticism poorly, partly because he was poorly taught. However, it's important not to find excuses for problems and simply address them, especially in production when your team leader needs changes, particularly with the competition.
I bought these lamps to supplement the light my new vegetable plants get from the window. I love many of the features of these lamps. Pros: First, they are easy to attach to my shelf and bend into many positions, so I can make changes as my plants grow. The lamps are cool to the touch and have not caused any damage even when touching the plants. I believe my vegetables have benefited from the lamps. The lamps are dimmable, but I only use the strongest setting. I haven't used the timer yet, but I prefer to turn them on and off myself. I can imagine this feature being useful in an office with houseplants or on vacation. Cons: I don't think these lamps are strong enough to be the main light source for plants in a greenhouse. The lamps are small! If the lamps burn out, I have to buy a whole new unit.

The Asian Indoor Athletics Championships are being held for the first time on the territory of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The tournament is attended by over 500 athletes from 31 countries, who compete in the disciplines of running, relay, long jump, high jump, triple jump, pole vault, shot put and multi-event.

## Final English Translation:  I was lucky enough to spend six unforgettable months with Nicholas in 2011, supporting a range of projects. When we met over the weekend, I was thrilled to hear about the progress, especially with tree planting and farmer support. Thousands of trees have been planted, and farmers have been able to achieve higher yields through a range of measures, from support with equipment purchases to training.  
This is a very beautiful skirt. The lace pattern is elegant and soft. It doesn't wrinkle, even when it was squeezed in plastic and a box. That's really cool, because it was very smooth.

Statistics Norway figures showed that foreigners were scattered across the city districts. Thus, Søndre Nordstrand, the southernmost district in Oslo, had over 14,000 registered immigrants. Many immigrants also lived in desirable areas, with Frogner being the district with the fifth-highest number of foreigners. After that, Stovner, Bjerke, Grorud, Østensjø and Sagene made up the remaining ten districts in Oslo with the most residents from another country.

## Final English Translation:  The owner of the Russian private military company Wagner Group, which is actively participating in the fighting in Ukraine, has predicted that the war could drag on for years. Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video interview published late Friday that it could take between 18 months and two years for Russia to gain full control of the eastern Ukrainian industrial center of Donbas. He added that the war could last three years if Moscow decides to capture more territory east of the Dnieper.

## Final English Translation:  Gaziantep. Kazinform reported that Kazakh rescuers are continuing to dig through the rubble and search for survivors in Turkey. The press service of the Kazakh Ministry of Emergency Situations provided this information. The rescuers' efforts are being hampered by large amounts of debris and unstable structures. So far, the Kazakh rescue team has recovered seven earthquake survivors and the bodies of 19 people, including a child, in Turkey. Additionally, first aid is being provided around the clock. It is important to note that a 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck southeastern Turkey and northern Syria early Monday morning, causing widespread devastation. As of today, the death toll from the massive earthquakes in southeastern Turkey has surpassed 20,000.  
In our daily lives, we constantly seek ways to boost our energy and avoid burnout, especially in our jobs. This can be extremely challenging for people in healthcare, which is why I asked 30 health and wellness experts the same question: "How do you manage your energy and avoid burnout in your profession?" Their careers range from infectious disease specialists to psychologists to mindfulness teachers—and they all had great advice on how to stay motivated and keep going. Despite the wide differences in their roles, several themes in their responses stood out as ways to prevent burnout.  
## Russia suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in the fall as the Ukrainian military launched successful counteroffensives to retake large areas in the east and south. The Kremlin has avoided making predictions about how long the fighting could last, saying only that the so-called "special military operation" will continue until its goals are achieved. Russian forces have focused on the Ukrainian provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk, which make up the Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian troops since 2014.  
I had my whole head bleached and then dyed it with a black tint a few months ago. Then I had highlights done all over my head. A few weeks later, I dyed my hair with blue-green Arctic Fox hair dye and it wouldn't fade. I used this stuff with Olaplex No. 3 and it lightened SIGNIFICANTLY, removing the green and blue parts and lifting the dark tint. However, after a day I noticed a green tinge in my hair. It's getting worse every day and I've used the color remover twice now, with the same result. My hair is also getting darker where the tint was. This is a great product, it just doesn't seem to last long.  
A person was arrested during a protest outside Tate Britain, where a drag queen storytelling event for children was taking place.

And then I agree that there are many errors in this dictionary. So I asked you to create different versions of this dictionary by only taking the words that were observed five times. And only the pronunciations that were observed three times or more, or something like that. This way, these random errors, like the example with this repeated IBM instead of IBM, won't occur as often. But you will still have the variations in pronunciation, because if the person, let's say, says this "alzo," if you remember, if he says this "alzo" with a "Z" 20 times in conversation, then you will see it in the data with the "Z." And if he sometimes manages to say it correctly, then you will indeed see that again in the data. So I want [PERSON4] to stay in contact with [PERSON2]. Maybe stay in conversation, right? I have to go now because I have to give the kids lunch and so on. But please stay in this conversation and figure out together how you can use this dictionary. So [PERSON4], please show [PERSON2] which dictionary the system accepts. Share your screen and show it. And [PERSON2], please take a look and help convert the dictionary you created into this file. One thing that is still needed is the substitute model for the language model. But all these words should be known words. So [PERSON4], you need to find out which words are in the language model. And the words that are in the language model should simply be copied. The dictionary will have three columns. The grapheme, as it is output. A recognized form. The phonemes, as [PERSON2] suggested. And there will be multiple lines with different phoneme variations. And the third column will also be the same for everyone, and again it will be the same grapheme form. That's how the language model sees it. And I think that this way these systems should be able to load it. And you may encounter another problem: that it is not ready for two large custom dictionaries. So, that is also something that needs to be tested, but please test it, both of you together. So [PERSON2] knows what he created in the dictionary. And you know what the dictionary looks like when you create it manually, and you need to combine these two pieces of knowledge. Ah, so that it works with the generated dictionary.

3 1/2 Stars Remedy is a "brother's best friend" romance and a second chance romance combined. It is a unique story, and the hero (Grady) must do everything to win Collins back and prove that he is the man for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an incredible night together. Collins thought she would finally get everything she dreamed of, her brother's best friend, but when she woke up alone the next morning and never heard from him again, everything definitely changed. Now Grady is back, and he's not leaving, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left and that he won't give up on her this time. While I loved the premise of this story and sometimes liked Grady, he really got on my nerves. I understand his reasons for leaving that night, but not even sending a letter to Collins to explain himself? Leaving her in the dark and hurt for years and then expecting her to welcome him with open arms? Was he crazy?! Collins had every right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She had every right to resist him when he wanted her back and to move on. I admire her willpower because Grady was persistent. I loved Collins in this book; she was strong and protected her heart, and I admired her for that. Sure, she loved Grady, but she was afraid and hesitant to let him back into her life, who wouldn't be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite of the two. She definitely let things happen at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There is a lot of tension in this book, and I enjoyed watching the two reconnect as Collins began to forgive Grady. I just wish Grady hadn't been so whiny and had been a bit more understanding. He always said he understood, but sometimes he was a bit too pushy for me, and then he was sweet towards the end. In the end, I loved him just as much as Collins, but at the beginning of the book, I found it hard to read his perspectives because I couldn't connect with his character. The first part of this book wasn't my favorite, but the second part? I loved it, hence my rating. If you like second chances and "brother's best friend" romances, you might really enjoy this book; I just initially struggled with Grady and how he handled some things.

Derry City won the President's Cup after defeating Shamrock Rovers 2-0. The FAI Cup winners overcame last season's champions at the Brandywell thanks to first-half goals from Will Patching and Michael Duffy. The Hoops pressed for an equalizer in the second half, but Ruaidhri Higgins' team held firm to win the opening game. Derry travel to St Patrick's Athletic for their league opener next Friday. Patching's volley put Derry ahead after 23 minutes - the midfielder opened the scoring when the northerners won 2-1 against the eventual champions last February.  
There was particular dissatisfaction that Leigh Drennan, the chair of Labour North West and employee of the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting MP for Warrington North, Charlotte Nichols, did not make the shortlist to win back the seat from the Conservatives, despite receiving nominations from four major unions. Reeves said she had nothing to do with the candidate selection, but added: "I know it's really important that we have rigorous processes about who can be put on the longlist and who can be put on the shortlist."

Your case: Avoid Wifi connection - go Bluetooth! I bought this scale for my wife in October 2017. At that time we were in the middle of moving and were staying in a hotel. I couldn't connect this scale to the Wifi in the hotel. I decided to wait until we had moved into our house and I could set up my own Wifi system. March 2018 - I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won't connect. Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10 meters away from the Wifi unit. I have followed the YouTube setup video, without success. When I bought the device, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate with the phone. This system is limited to the router connection, which is usually not near the bedroom, unlike a mobile phone! I would not recommend this scale to anyone, because of the Wifi connection. Please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication instead. I am replacing this with a scale with a Bluetooth connection.

Waziri explained that these two tombs belong to prominent individuals who lived at the beginning of the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom - one of the most important periods of ancient Egypt. He said that the tombs are T-shaped in layout, a style commonly used in tombs from the 18th Dynasty. These consist of an entrance, a columned hall leading to a burial shaft, and walls with distinct inscriptions. Waziri added that Djehuty was the overseer of the state treasury and supervised the work of craftsmen and artists during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut.

"O'Mara's circumstances were 'quite extraordinary', Reeves said, but conceded: 'There are important lessons for the Labour Party and all political parties in candidate selection. But I would also say that we have seen in this Parliament the constant undermining of standards in politics, not least by a series of Prime Ministers and fines and parties and standards that fall far short of what one would expect.' She added: 'One thing I would say about the Labour Party is that when people do wrong, they lose the whip. And that simply doesn't happen in the Conservative Party.'"
Okay, here's the final English translation, incorporating the feedback and addressing the identified issues:  (PERSON6) So this is also an important thing that we should have been aware of months ago. Remember, I've been telling you since August that we want to evaluate on a later test set. And every time you all... It's not just you personally, [PERSON8]. There were other things, of course. But every time you thought about it, you thought, "This will be easy, we'll just run it." And it's not until you actually do it that you see all the problems. So this is known and common. This is how it always is. So this is a message for everyone. Before you try it, you never know what the problem will be. Like, for example, the call I had where someone was interviewing me, so they wanted to record the video. Zoom has never worked so badly for me as it did today during the recording. So before you do it, you can't tell if it will work or not. And here we come across the problems with converting the file formats. Hopefully we can get the numbers quickly. So do you already have word error rates?  
## Final English Translation:  I learned the hard way that local TV station websites are the absolute worst experience on the internet in 2023. Pop-ups, autoplaying videos, animations, popovers, and ads, ads, ads. I know they make their money from ads, but all the crap seems counterproductive when it drives people away. This is even true now that goatse.cx is gone, although it would be a head-to-head race between goatse and, say, khou.com, where I was trying to watch a video Wendy sent me.  
I think that is actually an interesting question, whether we can use limitations to reflect the speaker's gender in translation.
Jami slipped him the note as they passed each other on the path, shortly before the late-night watch. She was on her way to the wall, he had just finished his shift. He looked behind him to watch her go and to make sure they hadn't been seen. She didn't look back. He waited until he was in the darkness of the dormitory before pulling out the note and reading it in a shaft of light falling through the blackout curtains. One word in block letters. He stared at it for a long time, trying to stay calm:
Okay, here's the final English translation, incorporating the feedback and addressing the identified issues:  One of the fans sounded rough when unpacking. The fan controllers are really unreliable - if you turn them to 100%, the fans turn off. So you have to turn them to 100% and then slowly turn them back down until they start again. The build quality is average, but that seems to be the case with most products of this type in this price range. The feet that hold the laptop at an angle have broken off a few times. You can put them back in, but it happens often enough to be annoying. On the plus side, this cooler has ideal fan placement for laptops that draw air in through vents near the top of the laptop. Many other coolers have fans in the middle and offer very little additional airflow to a laptop with this type of cooling configuration.  
## English Translation:  Yes, if it has a limited context and because I make decisions based on a very short context for this very low latency, then it really commits to something that it then finds out in a second or two, oh well, that was actually a bad translation. So it tries to use a different wording. For example, to explain the matter more precisely. So, actually I liked it very much. I like some of the translations. I was really amazed, although you could see that the model made mistakes on the first try, it really wanted to make some kind of correction. And it definitely sounded very fluent, which I think is also important. If you really demand low latency, then I think a slightly lower quality is also okay if the fluency is good. Because if you have bad translation quality and bad fluency, then I think the translation is simply pointless. But if the lower quality is due to the fact that the translation, when you read everything, gets the same information, but the wording is simply bad because, for example, it used more words and made some corrections and so on. So, I think that's perfectly fine for simultaneous translation, as long as you don't lose any information. And for which language pairs do you have these results, for example? Because I would like to see it, just out of curiosity.

The incident occurred after a rise in the number of refugees and asylum seekers crossing the English Channel to the UK in boats. Police have arrested 15 people after an anti-refugee demonstration turned violent outside a hotel housing asylum seekers near the English city of Liverpool. Merseyside Police said one officer and two civilians were slightly injured in the disturbances on Friday evening in Knowsley. Police said some protesters threw objects and set fire to a police van. The arrested individuals, aged between 13 and 54, were taken into custody "following violent disorder". Merseyside Police Commissioner Emily Spurrell told Radio City: "It was incredibly dangerous, and there were a few injuries to police officers."
