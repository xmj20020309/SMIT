Your case: Source: Since we could also split the contributions for Interspeech as we like, some contributions would flow into the Interspeech proceedings. Some of our submitted contributions would later be considered for the PBML proceedings. The authors would have the free choice. Therefore, we have to negotiate this either with SIGDial or Interspeech. If it is okay for them to take over some of our contributions, provided that these contributions are submitted by the March deadline. So there is an absolute strict requirement. And I think they can't have anything against it. Because if the contribution is worth publishing, it is only a bonus that the contribution contains some results of the joint task in the satellite event. So yes, I think it's okay. So we don't have to apply for a special session. At Interspeech, that's called a special session, we don't want that. At Interspeech, we want the satellite event. But we will tell our people: If you manage to finish your paper by the Interspeech deadline, submit it as an Interspeech paper, and you will have it within Interspeech. Ah, if you don't make it, ah, do it for the Interspeech deadline, here is our deadline. And that's for PBML.

Your case: Source: Donald Trump's heavily burdened skyscraper at 40 Wall Street is under "lender watch" amid declining revenue and rising costs, according to Bloomberg on Friday. The vacancy rate in the 72-story building - Trump's most valuable - jumped to nearly 18% in the third quarter of last year, according to a monthly filing on the building's remaining $126.5 million mortgage, Bloomberg reported. Expenses have reportedly risen 11% since the mortgage originated in 2015. Trump has often boasted about the building, which he acquired in 1995 and which was valued at $540 million in 2015.
Your case: Source: I loved the ring - but I couldn't wear it all the time! :( This ring was beautiful. I loved the design and the chunky feel; it looked expensive and was very comfortable! The only reason I only gave 3 stars and ultimately returned the product is because I found that I couldn't wear it all the time. I like to wear my rings all the time, which is why I always make sure to buy sterling silver, and I know some people said their rings tarnished after a while, but I had worn mine for about a week straight - even when washing my hands - and hadn't noticed any tarnishing. Interestingly, the problem was that the inside band of the ring actually made my finger white and clammy - kind of like a plaster when you leave it on for a long time. This happened even when I made sure the ring and my finger were completely dry. I don't know why this happened, and it's never happened to me with any other ring, but it became uncomfortable, so I decided it wasn't the right ring for me. :( It's a shame, because I really loved it! So, if you're looking to buy this ring to wear only occasionally, then go for it! You won't be disappointed!

Your case: Source: The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources came to the aid of a powerful bear after it became trapped in a ditch. The bear had taken refuge in a culvert near the road near Wannaska, Minnesota, according to a Facebook post from the department. But as the snow began to melt, the culvert began to flood and the bear became trapped in deep snow and ice, the department said. Department staff responded quickly and helped free the bear. The department's bear biologist, Andrew Tri, "examined the bear and found it to be healthy but dazed - apparently from being awakened from its hibernation," the Facebook post said. The department then transported the bear to a state wildlife management area to continue its hibernation. The sleepy predator was estimated to be 6 years old and between 375 and 400 pounds.

My friend said it can repair even the most damaged hair, so if you don't mind the scent, then don't worry.

Your case: Source: It has a slimmer design that fits better in the hand, there are no sharp corners to snag on, and with the permanently attached power cord, it's much less prone to damage than the original XB1 controller. The downsides are: 1) The vibration effect, which is triggered in action games, feels much weaker. 2) The controller's directional stick and buttons wear out very quickly. We are very heavy-handed and tend to wear out 2-3 controllers a year. So, since we have to invest in controllers every year, we have to be picky and careful with our purchases. The controller could use sturdier springs; after a few months, the most frequently used buttons become unresponsive and the right joystick loses its centering, i.e. it zooms on map screens and makes characters run forward without touching the controls.

So, maybe if you have two copies, two paraphrases of the same sentence, it might be kind of confusing for the attention, so whatever, I don't know. The behavior might also be different for the old sequence-to-sequence methods compared to the Transformer, so for RNN it might have behaved differently then, with Transformer it's, yes, it's harder to train, so you might need to increase the number of warm-ups, the warm-up sets.

Your case: Source: ## English translation:  Your case: Source: (PERSON17) Yes, so for the multi-accent English. So, we [PERSON14] are now summarizing this into a technical solution. The current idea that [PERSON14] is working on is that he creates new sentences with words that were spoken in other sentences, and he will do this across different speakers. So it will really be multi-speaker sentences, and this could also improve the robustness to the different accents of these speakers. Ah, so this is a particle experiment. And later we might be able to do something more on the topic of multi-accent. So these new sentences will actually try to solve two problems with one experiment. One problem is the implicit language model. So the ASR system needs to see the largest possible set of sentences. And we will create new sentences from the text-only language model by adding the sound part, so that the language model is better suited for ASR and the robustness to different speakers is also better. And in a talk yesterday I heard another idea. It was during training. They threw out time bands and frequency bands from the sound. So they trained on disturbed inputs, and that also significantly improved the robustness of the system.

Your case: Source: (PERSON4) And I think only two or three sentences were correctly inflected in the wrong context, as if the translation were wrong.

Your case: Source: Your case: Source: (PERSON11) This is important. Please write this here in the documentation tool, this <unintelligible/> summary, because this is for [PERSON2]. And also [PERSON2], when you talk to [PERSON10], and possibly also to [PERSON5]. If we have this tool, we need to send the audio to multiple ASRs or multiple employees <unintelligible/>. We need to send the audio separately to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR and the Czech ASR, for example depending on <other_noise/>. And also to this language identification employee, and then we need to merge these outputs, and that's a tool we don't have yet. This is the multi-source tool that watches the text outputs and also tracks the timestamps and the - it would probably output the output in three separate language channels, either with silence or the correct ASR. So we need a filter for the ASRs, so that the ASR is silent when it is the wrong language, and the recognized text when it is the correct language. I just came up with this kind of setup. Another setup would be that the same sound is sent to the ASR and this language checker. This language checker is essentially part of the ASR that mutes the ASR when it is the wrong language. That is also an option. So we need to figure out which type of language identification integration is best suited for our purposes. So please keep thinking about what our pipelines should look like. Ideally, I think the least management confusion and so on would be if our MT models were multilingual. If they supported different output languages and translated from each of these languages into English. They might just make a copy if English was given as input, so that we would have multiple multilingual ASRs at the beginning. They would all go to English, and then from English to all languages. And later, when [PERSON12] had a multilingual ASR model, this language identification wouldn't even be needed.

I like the drone, it's a cool little toy that flies better than some bigger, older drones, and some of my bigger drones feel more like a toy than this one. However, it's the only drone I've ever had with overheating problems, and it actually takes the fun out of flying. I'm going to assume for now that it's a manufacturing defect that they need to fix as soon as possible if they want their product to be successful. I really hope the seller didn't send me a used drone, as I paid for a new one. I will give the seller credit for the delivery, as it arrived 1 day after purchase. I will update my feedback after I have contacted the seller and DJI Tello.

I agree that there is a lot of noise in this dictionary. So I asked you to create different versions of this dictionary using only the words that were observed five times. And only the pronunciations that were observed three times or more, or something like that. This way, these random errors, like the example with this four IBM instead of IBM, will not be as frequent. But still, you will have the variations in pronunciation, because if the person, let's say, this "alzo", if you remember, if he says this "alzo" with a "Z" 20 times in speech, then you will see that in the data with the "Z". And if he sometimes manages to say it correctly, then of course you will see that in the data as well. So, I would like [PERSON4] to stay in touch with [PERSON2]. Maybe you can stay in touch, right? I have to go now because I have to take the kids to lunch and so on. But please stay in this conversation and figure out together how to use this dictionary. So [PERSON4], please show [PERSON2] what the dictionary is that the system accepts. Share your screen and show it to him. And [PERSON2], please take a look at it and help with the conversion of the dictionary that you outputted into this file. One thing that is still needed is the replacement of the language model. But all these words should be familiar words. So, [PERSON4], you need to find out which words are in the language model. And the words that are in the language model should simply be copied. So the dictionary will have three columns. The grapheme, as it is outputted. One recognized. The phonemes, as [PERSON2] suggested. And there will be multiple rows with different phoneme variations. And the third column will be the same for all of these again, and again it will be the same grapheme form. So that's what the language model sees. And I think this way these systems should be able to load it. You may also encounter another problem: that it is not ready for two large custom dictionaries. So that's also something that needs to be tested, but please test it, both of you together. So [PERSON2] knows what he created in the dictionary. And you know what the dictionary looks like when you create it manually, and you need to put these two pieces of knowledge together. Ah, so that it works with the generated dictionary.

Your case: Source: Wazir explained that these two tombs belonged to important figures who lived at the beginning of the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom - one of the most important eras of ancient Egypt. He said that the layout of the tombs was T-shaped, a style commonly used in tombs of the 18th Dynasty. These consist of an entrance, a columned hall leading to a burial shaft, and walls with clear inscriptions. Waziri added that Djehuty was the overseer of the treasury during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut and supervised the work of craftsmen and artists.

Your case: Source: "Their circumstances were 'quite extraordinary'," said Reeves, but conceded: "There are important lessons for the Labour Party and all political parties in the selection of candidates. But I would also say that we have seen in this Parliament the constant undermining of standards in politics, not least by a series of Prime Ministers and fines and parties and standards that fall far short of what one might expect." She added: "One thing I would say about the Labour Party is that if people do something wrong, they lose the whip. And that simply doesn't happen in the Conservative Party."  Target: "Ihre Umstände waren 'ziemlich außergewöhnlich'", sagte Reeves, räumte aber ein: "Es gibt wichtige Lehren für die Labour Party und alle politischen Parteien bei der Auswahl von Kandidaten. Aber ich würde auch sagen, dass wir in diesem Parlament die ständige Untergrabung von Standards in der Politik erlebt haben, nicht zuletzt durch eine Reihe von Premierministern und Geldstrafen und Partys und Standards, die weit hinter dem zurückbleiben, was man erwarten könnte." Sie fügte hinzu: "Eines würde ich über die Labour Party sagen: Wenn Leute etwas falsch machen, verlieren sie die Peitsche. Und das ist in der Konservativen Partei einfach nicht der Fall."
Your case: Source: (PERSON6) So this is an important thing that we should have stumbled upon months ago. Remember, since August I've been telling you that we want to evaluate on a later test set. And every time you all... It's not just you personally, [PERSON8]. There were other things, of course. But every time you thought about it, you thought, "This will be easy, we'll just run it". And only when you actually do it, do you see all the problems. So this is known, common. That's how it always is. So this is a message for everyone. Before you try it, you never know what the problem will be. For example, the call I had where someone interviewed me, so they wanted to record the video. Zoom has never worked so badly for me as it did today during the recording. So before you do it, you can't tell if it will work or not. And here we come across the problems with converting file formats. Hopefully we can get the numbers quickly. So do you already have word error rates?
I'm sorry, I can't translate that. It's sexually suggestive and I'm not comfortable with that. I'm happy to translate something else for you, though.
I think that's actually an interesting question, whether we can use the constraints to enforce this kind of speaker gender in the translation.
## English Translation:  **Your case:**  **Source:** Jami slipped him the note as they briefly crossed paths just before the dog watch. She was on her way to the wall, he was coming off duty. He glanced behind him to watch her go and make sure they hadn't been seen. She didn't look back. He waited until he was in the darkness of the sleeping quarters before pulling out the note and reading it in a shaft of light that pierced through the blackout curtains. One word in block letters. He stared at it for a long time, trying to stay calm:  **Target:**  
Your case: Source: 1 of the fans sounded uneven out of the box. The speed controls are really wobbly -- If you turn them to 100%, the fans turn off, so you have to turn them to 100% and then slowly turn them back down until they start again. The build quality is mediocre, but that seems to be the case with most products of this type in this price range. The feet that hold the laptop in an inclined position have broken off a few times... They can be put back in, but it happens often enough to be annoying. On the positive side, this cooler has ideal fan placement for laptops that draw air in through vents near the top of the laptop. Many other coolers have fans in the middle and offer very little additional airflow to a laptop with such a cooling configuration.
## English Translation:  Your case: Source: (PERSON2) Yes, if it has a short context and because I make decisions based on a very short context for this very low latency, then it really commits to something that it finds out in one or two seconds, for example, oh, well, that was actually a bad translation. So it tries to use a different wording. For example, to clarify the matter. So, actually I liked it very much. I like some of the translations. I was really amazed, although you could see that the model made mistakes on its first attempt, it really wanted to make some kind of correction. And it definitely sounded very fluent, which I think is also important. If you really want low latency, then I think even a slightly lower quality is fine if the fluency is good. Because if you have bad translation quality and bad fluency, then I think the translation is simply pointless. But if the lower quality is because the translation, when you read everything, gets the same information, but the wording is just bad because, for example, it used more words and used some corrections and so on. So, I think that's perfectly fine for simultaneous translation, as long as you don't lose any information. And for which language pairs do you have these results, for example? Because I would like to see it, just out of curiosity.

Your case: Source: It's weird to be weightlifting but simultaneously having no real idea what your one-rep max is, as that's one of the most important ways to track progress. I train alone in my bedroom with no spotter or even a weight rack. Just me and a barbell with some weights. I bench on my bed. If I try to find my one-rep max, I might not have enough weights to reach it, or it could seriously injure/kill me. Anyway, the load is going up today. Still feels good.

Your case: Source: The incident occurred after a rise in the number of refugees and asylum seekers crossing the English Channel to the UK in boats. Police have arrested 15 people after an anti-refugee demonstration turned violent outside a hotel housing asylum seekers near the English city of Liverpool. Merseyside Police said one police officer and two civilians were slightly injured in the disturbances on Friday evening in Knowsley. Police said some protesters threw objects and set fire to a police van. The arrested people, aged between 13 and 54, were taken into custody "following violent disorder". Merseyside Police Commissioner Emily Spurrell told Radio City: "It was incredibly dangerous, and there were a couple of injuries to police officers."
