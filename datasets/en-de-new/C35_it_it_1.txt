I swear, Burrata didn't exist five years ago.
I'm not quite sure why my brain can't figure it out; it could be because the tools are simply so wide-ranging and vague that my brain is blocked due to 'too many options'.
For Interspeech, we could also split it paper by paper. So that some papers would be included in the Interspeech proceedings. And some of our submitted papers would come later for the PBML proceedings. And the authors could choose freely. So we need to negotiate this either with SIGDial or Interspeech. Whether it's okay for them to have some of our papers, provided these papers are submitted by the March deadline. So there is an absolutely strict requirement. And I think they can't object to that. Because if the paper is worth publishing. It's just a bonus that the paper contains a shared task result that appears in the satellite event. So yes, I think it's okay. So we don't need to ask for a special session. At Interspeech it's called a special session, we don't want that. At Interspeech we want the satellite event. But we will tell our people. If you manage to finish your paper by the Interspeech deadline, submit it as an Interspeech paper and you will have it at Interspeech. Ah, if you don't make it for the Interspeech deadline, here is our deadline. And that's for PBML.
My neighbor and I arrived home at the same time, and I could hear him coughing and expelling Covid phlegm from across the street. So I hurried to get into my apartment to avoid him, but he still managed to catch up with me to chat. I swear, Covid-infected people are like zombies trying to infect everyone else.
Yes, well, I mean, I just did the same thing.
This would be mainly for surfing the internet, occasional emails and some games.
Okay, so a question just for me to make sure: In the concatenation settings, you insert the sentence separation token, right? Do you have a special token to distinguish what is the source and what is the context or the other sentence, or do you simply concatenate them without anything and hope that the system learns it?
According to a Bloomberg report on Friday, Donald Trump's heavily mortgaged skyscraper at 40 Wall Street is under "lender watch" due to plummeting revenues and rising costs. The vacancy rate in the 72-story building - Trump's most valuable - rose to nearly 18% in the third quarter of last year, according to a monthly report on the remaining $126.5 million mortgage, Bloomberg reported. Meanwhile, expenses have increased by 11% since the mortgage began in 2015. Trump has often boasted about the building, which he acquired in 1995 and which was valued at $540 million in 2015.
Loved the ring - but couldn't wear it all the time! :( This ring was beautiful. I loved the design and the chunky feel; it looked expensive and was very comfortable! The only reason I gave only 3 stars and ultimately returned the product is that I realized I couldn't wear it all the time. I like to wear my rings constantly, which is why I always make sure to buy Sterling Silver, and I know some people said their rings tarnished after a while, but I had worn mine continuously for about a week - even while washing hands - and hadn't noticed any tarnishing. Interestingly, the problem I had was that the inside of the ring actually made my finger white and moist - similar to a Band-Aid when worn for a long time. This happened even when I made sure the ring and my finger were completely dry. I don't know why this happened and have never experienced it with any other ring, but it became uncomfortable, so I decided it wasn't the right ring for me. :( A shame, because I really liked it a lot! So if you buy this ring with the intention of wearing it only occasionally, I say: Go for it!! You won't be disappointed!
Oh yes, I just don't know if you caught it when we were talking about [PERSON1], but one thing is that the (hit) is better, but the other is that the lemmata are actually manually inflected correctly, but that's not a problem, it's actually good that it's correct, yes. So, I thought it could be. But I'm not sure if we have test data for that, but we could try to experiment with some kind of style transfer with the models? As you know, we can use a constraint and instead try to use a synonymous constraint and see or compare how, what the difference is between the outputs. But that's, I'm just describing it vaguely because I don't have a precise idea myself of how to do it, but it could be an interesting, different scenario. I don't know, [PERSON1], do you know of any style transfer data for English-Czech? Do we have something like that?
Actually, I haven't achieved anything. I'm glad that a few people came to me privately and said: "Look, because of all your work, I'm going to grant you this amount of money."
At the other end of the spectrum, only 184 foreign residents lived in Marka and just over 700 in the central city district. Ullern, Vestre Aker and Nordstrand formed the other districts with the fewest foreign residents. However, these districts had significantly more immigrants than the center of Oslo and Marka. Those from EU and EEA countries as well as from the United Kingdom lived mainly in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo and St. Hanshaugen. While many citizens from Asia, including Turkey, also lived in Gamle Oslo (5,837), the majority were registered in the districts of Alna, Stovner and Søndre Nordstrand.
On the day of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center and killed 3,000 people, Trump boasted in a TV interview that 40 Wall Street suddenly became the tallest building in the city. His claim was not only insensitive but also a lie.
The disgraced former MP Jared O'Mara "should never have been selected as a Labour candidate" and deserves his four-year prison sentence, the shadow chancellor said. Rachel Reeves was speaking to the Guardian in the Bolton North East constituency on Friday, just hours after key local party figures had resigned in protest at the way the Labour party's national executive committee (NEC) was controlling the parliamentary selection process for the next general election.
This is a very brief outline of a plausible argument that theories about the influence of capitalism on the actual content of science are compatible with theories that assert the existence of objective scientific facts. It is *not* an argument for the existence of objective scientific facts, which I do not believe in.

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources came to the aid of an unlucky bear after it was trapped in a ditch. According to a Facebook post by the agency, the bear had settled in a drainage pipe next to the road near Wannaska, Minnesota. However, as the snow began to melt, the drainage pipe began to flood and the bear became trapped in deep snow and ice, the agency said. Department staff responded quickly and helped to free the bear. The department's bear biologist, Andrew Tri, "examined the bear and declared it healthy but groggy - obviously because it had been awakened from its hibernation," according to the Facebook post. The department then relocated the bear to a state wildlife management area so it could continue its hibernation. The sleepy carnivore was estimated to be 6 years old and weighed between 170 and 180 kilograms.

Modrow, a reform-oriented communist, took over leadership of the GDR shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall and later invited opposition forces into the government, but could not slow the growing momentum towards German reunification. "The entire peaceful process of establishing German unity was indeed a special achievement of his," the Left party wrote on Twitter. "This will remain his political legacy." During his 16-year tenure as party leader in Dresden from 1973, Modrow built a reputation as an anti-establishment figure. He rejected party privileges and insisted on living in a normal apartment.

I don't remember, so I don't remember exactly, but it's like - when I started these multi-source experiments in the summer. The first thing I started with was concatenating the paraphrase and the source, and maybe I, I don't remember now, I can check by the next meeting if I also tried, if the sources are in the first place, then a separator and the paraphrase in the second place. I might have also tried to randomly mix the two things, yes, and I just remember that it did this compenetration stuff extensively and tried multi-encoder.

A pedestrian has died after a collision with a car in Fife. The 38-year-old woman was taken to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy following the accident on Friday around 1:30 PM on Broad Street in Cowdenbeath. A 24-year-old man was subsequently arrested in connection with the accident. Police are asking witnesses or people with dashcam footage to come forward. Sergeant Lee Walkingshaw said: "Our investigations are ongoing and we ask anyone who was in the area and witnessed the accident to contact us. I would also like to appeal to anyone who was driving in the area and may have dashcam footage that could assist our investigation to contact us. Anyone who can help is asked to call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 1638 of Friday, February 10, 2023."
I'm sorry, what? My friend recommended the mask from this line, so I bought this, the conditioner, and the all-in-one milk. I can't say anything about the product's effectiveness because the smell was simply unbearable. You know that musty smell that old buildings use in women's restrooms to cover up the smell of *ladies*, but it just ends up as this sour, chemical, somewhat musty grandma smell? Yes, that's all I can think of when I smell this. You know, different people, different tastes, so maybe you'll like the smell. My friend said it could help even the most damaged hair, so if you don't care about the scent, then no worries. I know that natural products don't smell as nice as some synthetic ones, but I feel like more and more natural lines care less about it since it will sell anyway, and now everything just smells like play-doh. I've lost a few favorite lines because they changed the formula to cheaper ingredients. I don't know if that's the case here or if it's a counterfeit (which I asked Davines about and they said it wasn't), but this smells like Y U C K and I had to return it.
The news that Special Counsel Jack Smith has subpoenaed Mike Pence raises the question: How will Team Trump use the courts to obstruct this latest development in the Justice Department's investigation? The short answer is that any attempt to thwart Pence's subpoena based on executive privilege should fail. First, there's the basic question of whether a former president can even assert the privilege. Remember that Trump tried and failed to prevent the January 6 committee from obtaining White House records.

The tombs of Djehuty and Hery were inaugurated on Thursday after completion of restoration work. The inauguration was conducted by the Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Egypt, Mostafa Waziri, the Spanish Ambassador to Egypt, Alvaro Iranzo, and the President of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Eloísa del Pino. Waziri explained that the two tombs were discovered by the joint Egyptian-Spanish archaeological mission of the Supreme Council of Antiquities and CSIC, which has been active since 2002. He said that the mission carried out excavation and restoration work and published research on the tombs, which are located in the area of Dra Abu al-Naga on the west bank of Luxor. They managed to uncover many tombs, sarcophagi, mummies and a burial garden.
Humanity releases in 5 days. It's exciting, nerve-wracking, stressful, and all the good things I love about working in the games industry. What will people think of it? I like it, but will it be able to attract an audience of the right players? Will a community develop around the user-generated content of the game? (I really hope so.) The game's story, the ideas and questions it raises, feel timely. I hope everything goes well.

How would you share personal libraries?
The book was difficult to follow as it jumped back and forth a lot. Additionally, the title doesn't fit the story. The author implied that several people were infected by this alien, but left out many details about when or how it happened. I was confused at times and had to go back and reread a lot to make sure I hadn't missed anything.
For the upcoming meetings, I asked about the demand because I saw the demo of the (meme) project. They do offline subtitling. That's somewhat simpler than what we do. They still have the same segmentation problems and so on. But their task in translation is shortening, simply because the data becomes shorter. This is because their target size is the subtitles created for the hearing impaired. So there's a natural shortening in the data. It would be great if we could also find such types of data where natural shortening occurs. We would incorporate it into the architecture.

But after decades of barely reading anything (except for functional work-related non-fiction and occasional self-help books), I've set myself the goal of reading 23 books in 2023.
I tried, I estimate two tokens and yes, like because in the first version we suspected that the token itself could also be tokenized, so I replaced it with another token that is not just for this purpose, because we used a pre-trained dictionary, and this dictionary did not contain delimiter tokens. So I used a token that I assumed would not be tokenized into multiple parts and thus would only appear once. I had no guarantee that this token could not appear elsewhere in the sentence and that it could only appear in this place. So it could be done more carefully, yes, I agree with that.

Confusing plot
It has a slimmer shape that fits better in the hands, there are no sharp corners to get caught on, and with the fixed power cable, it is much less prone to damage than the original XB1 controller. The disadvantages are: 1) The vibration effect triggered in action games feels much weaker. 2) The directional joystick and buttons of the controller wear out very quickly. We handle them very roughly and normally wear out 2-3 controllers per year. So since we have to invest in controllers annually, we need to be selective and careful with our purchases. The controller could use more durable springs; after a few months, the most frequently used buttons no longer respond, and the right joystick loses its centering, i.e., screen maps zoom and characters move forward without touching the controls.
Very beautiful guitar. It's a shame that the company doesn't know how to protect their product. Don't even bother trying to get an undamaged one. We returned two due to shipping damage, and the third was also damaged. We gave up. They ship them in the soft, thin case with a sheet of packing paper in a cardboard box. No padding at all.

As she further explained, there's a method to a strategy that most people inside the Beltway would consider madness: This is the best way to gain the trust of the press. They'll know we're not sugarcoating like everyone else. SIGTARP will quickly become the only credible source of information in Washington about TARP. We might sometimes be embarrassed and disclose things that we - and others - could easily conceal, but we'll shock the press with our honesty. No one else does this, and soon we'll have a built-in defense when we're attacked. No matter what they hear, the press will come to us first and believe us because we'll prove to them that we're telling the truth. This might be the most important reason for Biden to take the path of radical accountability: In every presidency, moments inevitably arise when it's crucial to have the trust of the public and the institutions that protect civic interest. Moreover, there's important capital to be gained by owning up to our mistakes, and Biden can draw an important distinction from his political opponents. The President would do well to follow the old adage: Tell the truth - and shame the devil.
Forget me, okay. Ignore me, okay. It hurts, but you have to do what you think is right.
Yes, because I think it's a method that's very easy to test, and it should always be tested in comparison to the two encoders, and I would expect it to sometimes be better and sometimes worse than the configuration with two encoders, depending on the exact task, so what exactly the second thing is that you're encoding. So if you have two copies, two paraphrases of the same sentence, it might be somewhat confusing for the attention or whatever, I don't know. The behavior could also be different with the old sequence-to-sequence methods compared to the transformer, so maybe it behaved differently with RNNs, with the transformer it's harder to train, so you might need to increase the number of warm-ups, warm-up sets.

I only have good things to say about this gift bag set. I was able to wrap all my Christmas presents with the bags, wrapping paper, and tissue paper. The product is of great quality and the various size options make it easier to choose the perfect one for each gift! I highly recommend it. The seller is absolutely lovely and attentive. They contacted me after my purchase to ensure I was satisfied with my product. 5 stars across the board!

I quite like akkoma, the software and the domain name I got for my instance. But somehow I feel like I started this instance on the wrong foot, so to speak. And I never really felt comfortable there. I'll stay here a little longer and think about whether I should migrate at all.
So, since this applies here, I had to extend my viewport implementation with the IDirect3DViewport3 methods to fix the issue, so that the call to the new method was valid.
Even TERFs and similar groups recognize intersex because it is generally more physical and thus visible. Just as mental health is seen by many as less "real" than physical health, I somehow have the feeling that being trans is merely intersex of the mind.
The Biden Justice Department "does not want an armed citizenry"
Yes, so for the multilingual English. We are now bringing this together with [PERSON14] into a single technical solution. The current idea that [PERSON14] is working on is that he creates new sentences with words that were spoken in other sentences, and he will do this across different speakers. So these will really be sentences with multiple speakers, and this could also improve robustness against the various accents of these speakers. So this is a partial experiment. And later we might do more regarding the multi-accent thing. So these new sentences will try to solve two problems with one experiment. One problem is the implicit language model. So the ASR system needs to see the largest possible number of sentences. And we will create new sentences from the pure text language model by adding the sound part, so that the language model for the ASR becomes better and the robustness against different speakers also improves. And in a presentation yesterday, I heard another idea. During training, they left out time bands and frequency bands from the sound. So they trained with disturbed inputs, and this also significantly improved the robustness of the system.
Your case: (By the way, I have tried almost every "humane" trap on the market with very little success. I'm not particularly happy about killing them, but I won't accept any comments on the ethics of killing mice.)
And I believe only two or three sentences were correctly inflected in the wrong context, as the translation was incorrect. And then there are some cases where the translation was completely wrong because the sentence was really wrong, and that part must be <unintelligible>, but those were only one or two cases.
This is important. Please write this here in the documenter, this <unintelligible/> summary, because it's for [PERSON2]. And also [PERSON2], when you speak with [PERSON10], and possibly also [PERSON5]. When we have this tool, we need to send the audio file to multiple ASRs or multiple workers <unintelligible/>. We need to send the audio file separately to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR and the Czech ASR, for example depending on <other_noises/>. And also to this speech recognition worker, and then we need to merge these outputs, and that's a tool we don't have yet. That's the multi-source tool that would observe the text outputs and also track the timestamps and probably output into three separate language channels, either through silence or the correct ASR. So we need a filter for the ASRs so that the ASR is silent when it's the wrong language, and it's the recognized text when it's the correct language. I just came up with this kind of setup. Another setup variant would be that the same audio is sent to ASR and this language checker. This language checker is essentially a part of the ASR that mutes the ASR when it's the wrong language. That's also an option. So we need to figure out which type of speech recognition integration is best for our purposes. So please keep thinking about what our pipelines look like. Ideally, I think, our MT models would be multilingual to cause the least administrative confusion and so on. If they would support different source languages and translate from each of these languages into English. They might simply copy if English was given as input, so that we would have multilingual multiple ASRs at the beginning. All go into English, and then from English into all languages. And later, if [PERSON12] had a multilingual ASR model, speech recognition wouldn't even be necessary anymore.
Well, one of them was for me yesterday.

The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching as you land the flyer on the red ground, but they don't move towards you; in fact, they remain motionless as you climb out of the flyer and slowly approach them. The ground beneath your feet begins to tremble and then quake, as if in an earthquake, and you lose your footing, although the Repnids appear unaffected. The rock beneath you suddenly gives way. The Repnids have dug tunnels beneath the surface, and you fall into a seething mass of hundreds of Repnid bodies in a cave below. The end comes quickly as several pairs of fangs inject their deadly venom and the air of Dyskra contaminates your lungs. No one will ever know that you were the first human time traveler.
The more I read about studies on sexuality, gender, and psychology, the more the statement "My biological sex is male, my gender is female" seems simplistic and imprecise to me. It almost feels like conceding part of the argument to TERFs. I believe being trans means being "biologically non-binary". My biological sex is non-binary, my gender is female.
Antonio Conte has complained about the defense, and this player is currently having difficulties defending. He is facing very good players like Barnes and Maddison, but it is very disappointing. Although the goal was disallowed, Leicester restored their 4-1 lead with Barnes nine minutes before the end of the game. Despite the victory against Manchester City last week, Tottenham missed the chance to move past Newcastle into third place.

Before buying, I asked the seller if the color was too yellow, and I was told it was like antique gold, darker. Not at all! The set looks VERY cheap. It's super shiny yellow with many cubic zirconias, even shinier. Looks great in the photo, but in reality I wouldn't even give it to a teenager to wear.
Nevertheless, unimaginable fear, terror, and displacement have left them with the invisible scar of trauma.
The battery life is terrible on the one I bought from Amazon. I still can't believe that Logitech discontinued this remote, nothing else even comes close. I absolutely LOVE this Harmony remote, this is my fourth. The dog chewed up the first one, my husband knelt on the screen of the second one, and the third one still works but there's an elbow mark in the middle of the touchscreen, also thanks to my husband... I bought this as a replacement, and the screen is great, but the battery it came with maybe holds a charge for a few days. My original (the third) holds a charge for weeks, and I use my remote for everything.

Africans formed the third largest group of immigrants in Oslo, with 28,020 people from Africa living in Oslo. Europeans from countries not part of the United Kingdom, EU or EEA were the fourth largest group, accounting for 15,566 residents of Oslo. From here, the size of the groups decreases significantly. For example, in 2022 there were just under 7,000 citizens from South American countries, while there were slightly over 3,000 nationals from North and Central America. Meanwhile, fewer than 700 people from Oceania lived in Oslo.
I bought these in February. Recently I tried to use them, and unfortunately my Keurig machine gives me an error message every time I try one, saying the capsule is not compatible with my machine. I've been using Donut Shop capsules in my machine since I first bought it and never had a problem. Upon closer inspection of the coffee capsule, I noticed that the code printed on top of the capsule is not very legible, so I can only assume I have a faulty package. I bought a pack of 72, which is 6 packs of 12 each. I even tried one from each of the 6 packs and keep getting the same error message. I know it's not my machine because other capsules I try work perfectly. I only have this problem with this delivery. Very disappointing as my return window has expired. UPDATE: I spoke with a customer service representative who refunded my money. Thank you AMAZON for your wonderful customer support!
The topic this week at Revelations is "Staying awake all night". I've been playing with this little piece in my head for a few days. It's definitely more romance than dirt.

Adriana Kuch, 14, was found dead in her home in Bayville on February 3, two days after the disturbing video of the attack at Central Regional High School was posted online. The video showed girls throwing a drink on the teenager, then kicking her and dragging her through the school hallways. They pushed Adriana against red lockers lining the school corridors, and one of the girls in a pink shirt repeatedly hit Kuch.
I'm giving it 3 stars for now. I don't want to give the seller a bad review unless they deserve it, but this drone overheats significantly. I'm not sure whether I should contact the seller or DJI Tello itself, but I'll probably try both just to see what they say. I like the drone, it's a cool little toy that flies better than some larger older drones, and some of my larger drones feel more like a toy than this one. However, it's the only drone I've ever had overheating issues with, and it actually takes the fun out of flying. For now, I assume it's a manufacturing issue that they need to address as soon as possible if they want their product to be successful. I really hope the seller didn't send me a used drone, as I paid for a new one. I have to give the seller credit for the delivery, as it arrived the day after purchase. I will update my review after contacting the seller and DJI Tello.

Later in life, Modrow served on the Council of Elders of the Left Party. "Hans was a deeply sincere and combative socialist," tweeted Dietmar Bartsch, the chairman of the Left parliamentary group. "Until old age, he was an important advisor in our party, whose wisdom will be missed."
Yes, I think - wasn't it Dominik who did some experiments with Ivana? I believe last year or two years ago for double empty, where they considered the context or concatenated the context with the input sentence and performed a kind of document-wide translation. But the problem with this concatenation is that you're not quite sure if it has the same effect as our multi-encoder setup.
Great attention is paid to the development of sports infrastructure. A clear proof of this is this athletics complex with over six thousand seats," the letter from the Kazakh president states. Kazakh athletes compete successfully in major world championships and represent Kazakhstan. They are role models for the younger generation and inspire youth to achieve great victories, Tokayev noted. He expressed confidence that hosting the Asian Championships in Astana will give new impetus to the development of athletics in the country, and promised increased cooperation with international organizations in this field.

And my idea is that a customer clicks this microphone button and starts speaking, and while the user is speaking, you send the audio in small parts simultaneously. Let's say 200 or even 100 milliseconds. And to the HTTP server, you put it in a queue, which I will process later with (ASR). And the model will perform some logic and inference with it. And whenever it has a new piece of transcription, it will be sent back, and the user should receive the partial transcript. And it should be displayed immediately in the text field.

Your case: Echidna with amethyst and magenta colored spines. You are average in height, have an average build and are muscular. Your tail is extremely thick. Your hair is raspberry colored, short and curly. Your eyes are pear-shaped and you wear scarlet cat-eye glasses. Your most interesting feature is your good deeds.
To play around a bit with Flutter. Honestly, I'd be reluctant to build my business on Google's technology, but on the other hand, Google is one of the few big players with real incentives to create a convincing cross-platform experience, and it shows.
Abe keeps his worries to himself and laughs easily, while Tom isn't afraid to cry but is less amused by crude humor. Jan will hurt you before letting you see that she's hurt, and laughs the most when things are turned upside down. Mio knows that sorrow is a constant companion in life.
I was disappointed when I received this article, as the silver part surrounding the face seemed to be made of some kind of cheap plastic. It wasn't the fact that it was made of plastic that disappointed me, but rather that the plastic used made it look incredibly cheap. For me, this detail ruined the entire appearance. I also didn't trust that it would withstand daily use, so I returned it. I was disappointed because it would have been a good deal if it weren't for that. However, if you can overlook this, it might be right for you. It was well packaged and arrived quickly.
I've had enough of conservative parties and governments that claim to be business-friendly. They are not, at least not in Alberta.
Tim Sherwood tears apart 44 million pound new signing Pedro Porro after miserable Tottenham debut
You land the flyer nose-up on the side of the slag heap and get out. The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching, but they don't move towards you; in fact, they are motionless as you slowly approach them. You stop while still standing on the pile of crumbled rock and earth, and speak to them: "I come in peace, as a friend." It seems they can't hear you, let alone understand you, as your universal translator doesn't receive a response. You decide to use your psychic perception to contact them mentally. It's difficult to understand their thoughts; they are frighteningly alien and your mind recoils from the contact. You decide that another attempt at contact would be dangerous and return to your flyer, but the experience has cleared your mind, which had been confused since your jump into the future. Back in Falcon's Wing, it's easy for you to plan a course to Earth in the year 3034 AD. Note that you have used another polybdenum rod when you jump.
I think for the text flow we use something like Hypercore, but I'm not sure if that would work for this.
This evening, a recently graduated artist took criticism poorly. Partly because he was poorly taught. But it's important not to make excuses for problems and simply fix them, especially in production when your director needs changes. Especially considering the competition.
I bought this lamp to supplement the light my new vegetable seedlings were getting from the window. I love many of the features of these lamps. Advantages: First, they easily attach to my shelf and bend into many positions, so I can make changes as my plants grow. The lamps are cool to the touch and have not caused any damage even when touching the plants. I believe my vegetables have benefited from the lamps. The lamps are dimmable, but I only use the strongest setting. I haven't used the timer as I prefer to turn them on and off myself. I can imagine this feature would be useful in an office with houseplants or while on vacation. Disadvantages: I don't think these lamps are strong enough to be the main light source for seedlings. The lamps are small! If the lamps burn out, I have to buy a whole new unit.
I would like to see how these companies that facilitate transactions explain to their customers how they set their percentages. They won't talk about it on Bloomberg! But if Spotify has a good quarter, they will.

Yes, I believe he told us at the beginning of the semester that we would get an A if we wanted an A. We just had to submit it within the second deadline. That was pretty much the only thing he asked for. But he also told us that, based on trends from previous years, many people don't do this. They find it easier to read for the exam. No, sorry, to study for the exam.

The Kazakh Prime Minister Smailov expressed special thanks to the President of the Asian Athletics Association Dahlan al-Hamad for his support in preparing and conducting the championships. The Asian Indoor Athletics Championships are taking place for the first time on CIS territory. The tournament brought together over 500 athletes from 31 countries who will compete in running, relay, long jump, high jump, triple jump, pole vault, shot put and multi-event. The tournament runs until February 12. Previously, it was reported that Kazakh runner Caroline Chepkoech Kipkirui won the gold medal in the women's 3,000 m and Olga Safronova won the silver medal in the women's 60 m at the tournament.

Working from home is enabling. It allows people to work in comfortable spaces rather than stuffy, noisy offices. It enables accessibility for anyone with an internet connection and a good workspace. It allows people to avoid long commutes that take time away from their day and their families.

I had the good fortune to spend six unforgettable months with Nicholas in 2011, supporting various projects. When we met over the weekend, I was pleased to hear about the progress made, especially in tree planting and farm support. Thousands of trees were planted, and farmers were able to increase their crop yields through a range of measures, from assistance in purchasing equipment to training.
This is a very beautiful skirt. The lace-like pattern is elegant and soft. It doesn't wrinkle, even after being stuffed into plastic and a box, it was very smooth, which is really great. It can be easily worn casually or dressy and has a certain vintage feel due to its length and cut, which I really like. I think this skirt could flatter anyone. I am 1.65 m tall and weigh 59 kg and ordered size S, so I would say if you feel you're between S and M, definitely choose the smaller size.

Yes, I was just thinking about what kind of data we are currently using for that, because if you check the models from [ORGANIZATION4] on [ORGANIZATION5], for example, they are already quite good at these things -
A 16-year-old boy was charged with murder of two students in a deadly shooting at a high school in Chicago in December, police announced on Friday. The suspect is charged with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder, as Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown stated. "We currently have no clear motive for why a 16-year-old wanted to shoot and kill other children," Brown said. The suspect's name was not released on Friday due to his age, although Brown said he would be held accountable as an adult for murder and attempted murder.
The figures from Norway's Central Statistical Office showed that foreigners were distributed across all city districts, with Søndre Nordstrand, Oslo's southernmost district, having over 14,000 registered immigrants. Many immigrants also lived in desirable areas, as Frogner was the district with the fifth-highest number of foreigners. After that, Stovner, Bjerke, Grorud, Østensjø and Sagene made up the rest of the ten districts in Oslo with the most residents from another country.

The owner of the Russian private military company Wagner Group, which is actively involved in the fighting in Ukraine, has predicted that the war could drag on for years. Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video interview released late Friday that it could take 18 months to two years for Russia to gain full control of the eastern industrial heartland of Donbas in Ukraine. He added that the war could last three years if Moscow decides to capture larger territories east of the Dnieper.
And I think if we just - We could probably just get the data from them, because they have such a large amount of videos with different areas and different native languages of the speakers on [ORGANIZATION5]. And I had the idea that we could simply use a tool to basically download some filtered videos from [ORGANIZATION5] and create a training dataset from that.

Thank you very much to everyone who has downloaded the latest update for Leasey. There have been some very minor difficulties. Nothing that would set off alarm bells, but they are being addressed nonetheless. A small update will be released next week to fix these. Most of yesterday was spent installing the new update for some customers, and anyone who needed this assistance should have received it by now. Have a great day!
Well, I understand that in practice IDirectXObject2 is typically a true superset of IDirectXObject, without changed function signatures and with new methods added only at the end. But this is not universally the case; for these cases, it's important which interface you use to create the object in question.
Photos: After restoration work, Egypt inaugurates the tombs of Djehuty and Hery
Kazakh rescue workers continue to dig through the rubble in search of survivors in Turkey. The work of the rescue forces is hampered by large amounts of debris and unstable structures. So far, the Kazakh rescue team has recovered seven earthquake survivors and the bodies of 19 people, including a child, in Turkey. First aid is also provided around the clock. As is known, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 shook parts of southeastern Turkey and northern Syria early Monday. To date, the death toll from the massive quakes in southeastern Turkey has exceeded 20,000.
In our daily lives, we constantly look for ways to increase our energy and avoid burnout, especially in our jobs. This can be extremely difficult for those in healthcare, which is why I asked 30 health and wellness experts the same question: "How do you manage your energy and not burn out in your profession?" Their careers range from infectious disease specialists to psychologists to mindfulness teachers - and they all had good advice on how to stay motivated and keep going. Despite the big differences in their roles, there were several themes in their answers that emerged as ways to prevent burnout.
Russia suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in the autumn as the Ukrainian military launched successful counteroffensives to reclaim large areas in the east and south. The Kremlin has avoided making predictions about how long the fighting could last, stating that the so-called "special military operation" would continue until its goals are met. Russian forces have focused on the Ukrainian provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk, which form the Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014.
My case: I had bleached all my hair and then a few months ago dyed it over with a black hair dye from the drugstore. Then I had highlights done at a salon. A few weeks later, I dyed my hair with blue-green Arctic Fox hair dye that wouldn't wash out. I used this product with Olaplex No. 3, and it lightened my hair ENORMOUSLY, removing the green and blue parts and also lightening the dark hair dye from the drugstore. However, after a day, I noticed a greenish tone in my hair. With each day it gets worse, and I've now used the color remover twice, with the same result. My hair is also getting darker where the drugstore hair dye was. This is a great product, it just doesn't seem to last long.
A person was arrested during a protest outside Tate Britain where a drag queen story-telling event for children was taking place. The Metropolitan Police said one person was arrested on suspicion of making a racially aggravated comment towards a police officer outside the art gallery near Westminster. No injuries were reported, and officers remain at the scene, police said.

Every artist has been there and made the same mistakes. Good criticism serves to correct the problem quickly and is not directed against your abilities. It assumes that you have the ability to fix the problem or find a solution.

Your case: 3 1/2 stars Remedy is both a brother's best friend romance and a second chance romance in one. It's a unique story, and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to win Collins back and prove that he's the right one for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had a wonderful night together. Collins thought she would finally get everything she had dreamed of, her brother's best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning and never heard from him again, things definitely changed. Now Grady is back, and he's not going away, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left and that he's not giving up on her this time. While I loved the premise of this story, and at times Grady too, he really got on my nerves. I completely understand his reasons for leaving that night, but not even sending a letter to Collins to explain? Leaving her in the dark and hurt all those years and then expecting her to welcome him back with open arms? Was he delusional?! Collins was right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She was right to fight back when he wanted her back and wanted to move forward. I admire her willpower, because Grady was persistent. I liked Collins in this book, she was strong, and she protected her heart, and I admired her for that. Sure, she loved Grady, but she was scared and hesitant to let him back into her life, who wouldn't be after what he had done to her? Her character was definitely my favorite of the two. She definitely let things progress at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There's a lot of angst in this book, and I enjoyed seeing these two find their way back to each other as Collins began to forgive Grady, I just wish Grady hadn't come across as so whiny and had shown a bit more understanding. He kept saying he understood, but sometimes he was a bit too pushy for me, and then he was sweet towards the end. In the end, I loved him just as much as Collins, but at the beginning of the book, I had trouble reading his perspectives because I couldn't connect with his character. The first part of this book wasn't my favorite, but the second part? I loved that, hence my rating. If you like second chance and brother's best friend romances, you might really enjoy this book, I just had trouble with Grady at the beginning and how he handled some things.
But did I love it? Absolutely!
Derry City emerged victorious in the President's Cup as they triumphed with a 2-0 win against Shamrock Rovers. The FAI Cup winners defeated last season's champions at Brandywell thanks to goals from Will Patching and Michael Duffy in the first half. The Hoops pushed for a comeback goal in the second half, but Ruaidhri Higgins' team stood firm and won the opening game. Derry will travel to St. Patrick's Athletic for the league opener next Friday. Patching's side-footed volley put Derry ahead after 23 minutes - the midfielder scored the first goal when the Foyleside won 2-1 against the eventual champions last February.
There was particular dissatisfaction that Leigh Drennan, the chair of Labour North West and assistant to Jeremy Corbyn-supporting MP Charlotte Nichols for Warrington North, was not placed on the longlist to try to win back the seat from the Conservatives, despite receiving nominations from four major unions. Reeves said she had nothing to do with candidate selection, but added: "I know that it's really important that we have rigorous processes for who can get on the longlist and who can get on the shortlist."
In recent years, certain Hindu hardliners have raided shops selling Valentine's Day items, burned cards and gifts, and driven hand-holding couples out of restaurants and parks, insisting that the day violates traditional values and promotes promiscuity. Hindu nationalist groups like Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal have stated that such raids help to reaffirm a Hindu identity. Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi say his government has pushed a Hindu agenda and seeks to dominate the religion in a secular nation known for its diversity. While Hindus make up almost 80% of the nearly 1.4 billion people, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Jains account for most of the rest.
The hatred in literature class is even worse: I love to read. I had read most of the classics before I turned eighteen - although that was more a result of living in the middle of nowhere; out of desperation I even read the 1979 Encyclopedia Britannica.
Geeky student Arnie Cunningham falls in love with Christine, a rusty 1958 Plymouth Fury, and becomes obsessed with restoring the classic car to its former glory. As the car changes, so does Arnie, whose newfound confidence behind the wheel of his exotic beauty turns into arrogance.

In July 2022, California officials charged Kilcher with two counts of workers' compensation fraud, accusing her of illegally collecting more than $96,000 in disability benefits between October 2019 and September 2021. The period also includes several months during which Kilcher worked on "Yellowstone," although the actress claimed to be too injured to work. Kilcher turned herself in and was indicted in May.

It's ThinkPad day!! Came home during my lunch break and saw this standing outside uwu. I wish I could take it to work to continue setting it up. But that will have to wait until this evening.
Avoid WIFI connection - use Bluetooth! I bought this scale for my wife in October 2017. At that time, we were in the middle of a move and living in a hotel. I couldn't connect this scale to the WIFI in the hotel. I decided to wait until we had moved into our new home and I could set up my own WIFI system. March 2018 - I have set up my WIFI system, and this scale still won't connect. Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I'm only 3 meters away from the WIFI device. I followed the YouTube setup video, without success. When I bought the device, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the WIFI router to communicate with the phone. This system is limited to the router connection... which is usually not near the bedroom, unlike a phone! I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone because of the WIFI connection. Please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication instead. I'm replacing this with a scale that has a Bluetooth connection.

Wazir explained that these two tombs belong to prominent individuals who lived at the beginning of the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom - one of the most important eras of ancient Egypt. He said that the layout of the tombs is T-shaped, a style commonly used in 18th Dynasty tombs. These consist of an entrance, a columned hall leading to a burial shaft, and walls with distinct inscriptions. Waziri added that Djehuty was overseer of the state treasury and supervised the work of craftsmen and artists during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut.

The O'Mara circumstances were "quite extraordinary," Reeves said, but she conceded: "There are important lessons for the Labour Party and all political parties to draw in the selection of candidates. But I would also say that in this Parliament we have seen the constant undermining of standards in politics, not least by a series of prime ministers and penalties and parties and standards that fall far short of what one would expect." She added: "One thing I would say about the Labour Party is that when people do wrong, they lose the whip. And that's simply not the case with the Conservative Party."
This is an important matter that we should have discovered months ago. Remember, I've been telling you since August that we want to evaluate on a later test set. And every time, you all thought... It's not just you personally, [PERSON8]. There were obviously other things too. But every time you thought about it, you thought: "This will be easy, we'll just run it through". And only when you actually do it do you see all the problems. This is known, common. It's always like this. So this is a message for everyone. Before you try, you never know what the problem will be. For example, with the call I had where someone was interviewing me, they wanted to record the video. Zoom has never worked as badly for me as it did today for the recording. So you can't say beforehand whether it will work or not. And here we encounter the problems of converting file formats. Hopefully we'll be able to get the numbers quickly. So do you have any word error rates so far?
I found out the hard way that in 2023, local TV station websites are the absolute worst experience on the internet. Pop-ups, auto-playing videos, animations, overlays, and ads, ads, ads. I know advertising is their source of income, but all this junk seems counterproductive if it drives people away. This is true even now that goatse.cx is gone, although it would be a close race to the bottom between goatse and, for example, khou.com, where I tried to watch a video Wendy sent me.
I guess that's actually an interesting question, whether we can use the restrictions to enforce this type of speaker gender in the translation.
Jami slipped him the note as they passed each other on the way, just before the dog watch. She was heading to the wall, he was just coming off duty. He glanced behind to watch her go and to make sure they hadn't been seen. She didn't look back. He waited until he was in the darkness of the sleeping quarters before pulling out the note and reading it in a beam of light falling through the blackout curtains. One word written in block letters. He spent a long time staring at it, trying to stay calm:
Your case: One of the fans sounded unbalanced right out of the box. The speed controllers are really wobbly - If you set them to 100%, the fans turn off, so you have to turn them to 100% and then slowly turn them back until they start up again. The build quality is mediocre, but that seems normal for most of these products in this price range. The feet for propping up the laptop when it's tilted have broken off a few times... They can be reinserted, but it happens often enough to be annoying. On the positive side, this has an ideal fan placement for laptops that draw air from vents near the top of the laptop. Many other coolers have fans in the center and provide very little additional airflow for a laptop with such a cooling configuration.
Yes, if it has a short context and because I make decisions based on very short context for this very low latency, then it really commits to something that it finds out after a second or two, oh, that was actually a bad translation. So it tries to use a different wording. To specify the matter, for example. Actually, I really liked it. I liked some of the translations. I was really amazed that although you could see the model making mistakes on the first try, it really wanted to make some kind of correction. And it definitely sounded very fluent, which I also consider important. If you really demand low latency, then I think slightly lower quality is okay if the fluency is good. Because if you have poor translation quality and poor fluency, then I think the translation is simply pointless. But if the lower quality is due to the translation, when you read everything, you get the same information, but the wording is just bad because, for example, more words were used and some corrections and so on were made. So I think that's perfectly fine for simultaneous translations as long as you don't lose information. And for which language pairs do you have these results, so some examples? Because I'd like to take a look, just out of curiosity.

It's strange to be weightlifting but at the same time not really knowing what your one-rep max is, because that's one of the main ways people track their progress. I train alone in my bedroom without a spotter or even a weight rack. Just me and a barbell with lots of weights. I do bench presses on my bed. If I try to find out my one-rep max, I might not have enough weights to push my limits, or conversely it could seriously injure/kill me. Anyway, the weight is increasing today. Still feels good.

The incident occurs following an increase in the number of refugees and asylum seekers crossing the English Channel to Britain by boat. Police have arrested 15 people after an anti-refugee demonstration outside a hotel used to house asylum seekers near the English city of Liverpool turned violent. Merseyside Police said a police officer and two civilians suffered minor injuries in the unrest on Friday evening in Knowsley. Police said some demonstrators threw objects and set a police vehicle on fire. The arrested individuals, aged between 13 and 54, were taken into custody "following violent disorder". Merseyside Police Commissioner Emily Spurrell told Radio City: "It was incredibly dangerous and there were some injuries to police officers."
