I swear, Burrata wasn't available five years ago.
I don't know exactly why my brain can't figure this out, because maybe the tools are just so extensive and vague that my brain simply shuts down due to too many options.
Certainly! Here is the revised translation:  For the Interspeech conference, we could also split it up paper by paper. This way, some papers would go into the Interspeech proceedings, and some of our submitted papers would appear later as part of the PBML proceedings. The authors could choose freely. So we have to negotiate either with SIGDial or with Interspeech to see if it’s okay for them to receive some of our papers, since these papers will be submitted by the March deadline. There is a very strict requirement. And I think they can’t have any objections. Because if the paper is worth being published, it’s just a plus that the paper is a result of a shared task that appears in the satellite event. So yes, I think it’s okay. We don’t have to ask for a special session. At Interspeech, it’s called a special session, but we don’t want that. At Interspeech, we want the satellite event. But we will tell our people: if you have your paper ready by the Interspeech deadline, submit it as an Interspeech paper and it will be part of Interspeech. If you don’t make it by the Interspeech deadline, here is our deadline, and that’s for PBML.
My neighbor and I arrived home at the same time, and I could hear him having a phlegmy cough from across the street. So I hurried to get into my apartment to avoid meeting him, but he still managed to catch up with me to chat. I swear that people infected with coronavirus are like zombies trying to infect everyone else.
Yes, well, I mean, I just did the same thing just now.
That would be mainly for surfing the internet, now and then for emails, and some games.
Okay, so a question just for me, to ensure that you are inserting the token for sentence separation in the connection settings, correct? You have a special token to distinguish which is the source and which is the context or the other sentence, or do you just link them without anything, and hope that the system learns it?
Donald Trump's skyscraper at 40 Wall Street, burdened with high mortgages, is under "lender watch" against the backdrop of declining income and rising costs, Bloomberg reported on Friday. The vacancy rate of the 72-story building—Trump's most valuable property—jumped to almost 18% in the third quarter of last year, according to a monthly filing on the remaining $126.5 million mortgage, Bloomberg reported. Meanwhile, expenses have reportedly increased by 11% since the mortgage was taken out in 2015. Trump has often boasted about the building, which he acquired in 1995 and was valued at $540 million in 2015.
I really liked this ring – but I couldn't wear it all the time! :( This ring was very beautiful. I liked the design and how heavy it felt; it looked expensive and was very comfortable to wear! The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars and ultimately also returned it is because I realized I wouldn't be able to wear it all the time. I like to wear my rings all the time, which is why I always make sure to buy those made of sterling silver. I know some have said their rings tarnished after a while, but I wore mine continuously for a week – even while washing my hands – and didn't notice any tarnishing. Interestingly, the problem I had was that the inside of the ring made my finger white and moist – similar to when you wear a bandage for a long time. This happened even when I made sure both my ring and finger were completely dry. I don't know why this happened, and it has never happened with any other ring, but I didn't feel comfortable with it and decided that this ring wasn't right for me. :( What a pity, because I really liked it! So if you're buying this ring to wear occasionally, I can only recommend it!! You won't be disappointed!
Oh yes, I just don't know if you, if you <unintelligible/> noticed when we talked about [PERSON1], but one thing is that the (beat) is better, and the other thing is that the lemmas are really manually inflected, but that's another, no problem, it's even good that <unintelligible/> is correct, yes. So, I thought it might be. But I'm not sure if we have some test data for it, but we could try to play around with the models, with some kind of style transfer? As you know, we can use a constraint and try to use a synonymous constraint instead to see or compare what the difference between the outputs is. But I'm just describing it vaguely because I don't have an exact idea myself of how to do it, but it could have been an interesting, different scenario. I don't know, [PERSON1], do you know anything about style transfer data for English-Czech? Do we have anything there?
I haven't really achieved anything. I'm glad that a few people have come to me privately and said, "Look, because of all your work, I'm going to give you this sum of money."
At the other end of the spectrum, only 184 foreign residents considered Marka their home, and just over 700 lived in the downtown area. Ullern, Vestre Aker, and Nordstrand were the other districts with the fewest foreign residents. However, these had more immigrants than the Oslo city center and Marka. Immigrants from EU and EEA countries as well as from the United Kingdom mostly lived in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Alt-Oslo, and St. Hanshaugen. While many citizens from Asia, including Turkey, also lived in Alt-Oslo (5,837), the majority were registered in the districts of Alna, Stovner, and Søndre Nordstrand.
On the day of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when the World Trade Center was destroyed and 3,000 people were killed, Trump boasted in a television interview that 40 Wall Street was now the tallest building in the city. His claim was not only insensitive; it was also a lie.
The disgraced former MP Jared O'Mara "should never have been selected as a Labour candidate" and deserves his four-year prison sentence, said the shadow chancellor. Rachel Reeves spoke to the Guardian on Friday in the Bolton North East constituency, just hours after key figures of the local party had resigned to protest the manner in which the Labour-led National Executive Committee (NEC) had controlled the parliamentary selection process for the next general election.
This is a very brief outline of a plausible argument that theories of capitalism, which influence the actual content of science, correspond with theories claiming the existence of objective scientific facts. This is *not* an argument for the existence of objective scientific facts, which I do not believe in.

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources rescued a very unfortunate bear after it got trapped in a ditch. The bear had retreated into a drainage channel along the road near Wannaska, Minnesota, according to a Facebook post by the department. But as the snow began to melt, the water level in the drainage channel rose, and the bear became trapped in deep snow and ice, the department said. Department staff responded quickly and helped the bear escape. The department's bear biologist, Andrew Tri, "examined the bear and declared it healthy but shaken – apparently because it was awakened from its hibernation," according to the Facebook post. The department then took the bear to a state sanctuary so it could continue its hibernation. The tired bear was estimated to be 6 years old and weigh between 375 and 400 pounds.

Modrow, a reform-oriented communist, took over the leadership of the GDR shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall and later invited opposition parties into the government, but could not curb the increasing momentum of German reunification. "The entire peaceful course of the creation of German unity was precisely a special merit of his," wrote Die Linke on Twitter. "That will remain his political legacy." During the 16 years from 1973, when he was head of the Communist Party in Dresden, Modrow made a name for himself as an anti-establishment figure. He rejected party perks and insisted on living in a normal apartment.

I'm not sure, well, I don't remember exactly, but that's like when I started with these multi-source experiments in the summer. The first thing I did was linking paraphrase and source, and maybe I, I don't remember now, I can check by the next meeting if I also tried, I definitely tried placing the sources in the first position, followed by a delimiter and the paraphrase in the second position. It may be that I also tried to mix the two things arbitrarily, yes, and I just remember it involved a lot of integration work and trying out multi-encoders.

A pedestrian has died after a collision with a car in Fife. The 38-year-old was taken to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy by ambulance after the accident on Broad Street in Cowdenbeath on Friday around 1:30 p.m. A 24-year-old was subsequently arrested in connection with the accident. The police are urging witnesses or drivers with dashcams who filmed the accident to come forward. Sergeant Lee Walkingshaw said: "Our investigations are ongoing, and we ask anyone who was near the accident site and saw the accident, and drivers with dashcam videos that could assist in the investigations, to contact us. Anyone who can help should please call the police in Scotland at 101, quoting case number 1638, as well as the accident date, Friday, 10 February 2023."
Excuse me, what? A friend recommended the mask from this brand to me, so I bought the mask, the conditioner, and the all-in-one milk. I can't say if the product works because the smell was simply unbearable. Do you know that musty smell that old buildings use in women's restrooms to mask a certain odor, which then just becomes a sour, chemical, musty grandma smell? That's the only thing I can think of when I smell it. But there's no accounting for taste, maybe you like the smell. My friend said it helps even the most damaged hair, so if you don't mind the smell, no worries. I know natural products don't smell as good as synthetic ones, but I feel like more and more natural brands are indifferent now because it sells anyway, and now everything smells like modeling clay. I've had to give up many of my favorite brands because the formula was changed to cheaper ingredients. I don't know if that's the case here or if it's a fake (I called Davines and they said no), but it smells disgusting and I had to return it.
The news that Special Investigator Jack Smith has subpoenaed Mike Pence raises the following question: How will the Trump team use the court to thwart this latest development in the Justice Department's investigation? The short answer is that any attempt to thwart Pence's subpoena by invoking executive privilege is likely to fail. First, the question arises whether a former president can even claim the privilege. Let us remember that Trump unsuccessfully tried to prevent the January 6 special committee from obtaining documents from the White House.

The tombs of Djehuti and Hery were dedicated on Thursday after the completion of restoration work. The dedication was carried out by the Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities of Egypt, Mostafa Waziri, the Ambassador of Spain to Egypt, Alvaro Iranzo, and the President of the Supreme Council for Scientific Research of Spain (CSIC), Eloísa del Pino. Waziri stated that the two tombs were discovered during a joint Egyptian-Spanish archaeological mission of the Supreme Council of Antiquities and the CSIC, which have been collaborating since 2002. He said that the mission conducted excavation and restoration work, and it published research regarding the tombs, which are located in the Dra Abu al-Naga region on the west bank of the Nile in Luxor. They managed to uncover many tombs, coffins, mummies, and a burial garden.
Humanity is released in 5 days. It's exciting, nerve-wracking, and stressful, encompassing all the good things I love about working on games. What will people think about it? I like it, but will it also be able to attract an audience of the right players? Will a community form around the user-generated content of the game? (I hope so.) The story of the game, the ideas, and the questions it poses seem to be timely. I hope everything goes well.

How would you share personal libraries?
It was hard to follow the book as it jumped back and forth a lot. The name doesn't match the story either. The author says that several people were infected by this alien but omitted details of when and how it happened. I was sometimes confused and had to go back and read many passages again to ensure I hadn't overlooked anything.
For the upcoming meetings, I inquired about the demand because I saw the (Meme) project demo. They do offline subtitling, which is somewhat easier than what we do. They still have the same issues with segmentation and so on. However, their task in translation involves shortening, simply because the data is getting shorter. This is because their target size is the subtitles created for the hearing impaired, so there's a natural shortening in the data. It would be great if we could also find such types of data where a natural shortening occurs. We would integrate them into the architecture.
Trump's valuable building 40 Wall Street under "lender watch" after declining revenues: Report

After having read almost nothing for many years (except for functional, work-related non-fiction and occasionally a self-help book), I set myself the goal of reading 23 books in 2023.
I think I tried it with two tokens, and yes, because in the first version we suspected that the token itself might also be tokenized, so I repeated it with another token that is not intended solely for this purpose, because we used a trained dictionary, and this dictionary did not contain separation tokens. So I used a token that I assumed would not be tokenized into multiple parts and would only appear once. I had no assurance that this token could not appear elsewhere in the sentence, and this is the only place where it should appear. So it could be done better, yes, I agree.

Confusing storyline
The controller has a slimmer design that fits better in the hand and no sharp corners to snag on. With the power cable securely attached, it doesn't get damaged as quickly as the original XB1 controller. The disadvantages are: 1) The vibration effect in action games feels noticeably weaker. 2) The analog stick and the buttons wear out quickly. We play quite intensively, requiring 2–3 controllers per year. So if we invest in controllers annually, we have to be selective and careful about which ones we buy. The controller could have sturdier springs, because after just a few months the most-used buttons stop responding, and the right joystick no longer stays centered, suddenly zooming into overview maps or causing characters to run forward without touching the controls.
Very good-looking guitar. It's just a shame that the company doesn't know how to protect its product. Don't expect to get one that isn't damaged. We've already sent back 2 because they had shipping damage, and a third was also damaged. We've given up. They are delivered in the soft, thin case with a layer of brown packing paper in a cardboard box. Zero padding.

Biologists in Minnesota rescue captured black bear
As she went on to explain, behind this lies a strategy that most people inside the Beltway would consider crazy: This is the best method to gain the trust of the press. The press knows that we don't fib like everyone else. SIGTARP will quickly become the only credible source of information in Washington about TARP. Occasionally, we might be embarrassed and say something that we could easily sweep under the rug – and others would do the same – but we shock the press with our honesty. No one else does this, and sooner or later we will have built our own defense for when we are attacked. No matter what the press hears, they will always come to us first and believe us because we prove to them that we are telling the truth. This may be the most important reason for Biden to embark on the path of radical accountability: There will always be moments in every presidency when it is important to have the trust of the public and the institutions that protect the citizens' interests. Moreover, important capital can be gained when we own up to our mistakes, and here Biden can make an important difference compared to his political opponents. The president would do well to follow the old saying: Tell the truth — and shame the devil.
Forget me, okay. Ignore me, okay. It hurts, but you have to do it.
Yes, because I think it's a method that's very easy to test, and it should always be tested in comparison with the two encoders, and I would expect it to sometimes perform better and sometimes worse than with the two encoders, depending on the exact task, so what exactly the second thing is that you're encoding. So if you have two copies, two paraphrases of the same sentence, it might be somewhat confusing for the attention, whatever, I don't know. The behavior might also be different with the old sequence-to-sequence methods compared to the transformer, so with RNN it behaves differently, maybe with the transformer, yes, it's harder to train, so you might need to increase the number of warm-up steps.

I can only say good things about this selection of gift bags. I was able to wrap all my Christmas presents with the bags, wrapping paper, and tissue paper. The product is very high quality, and the different size options make it easy to choose the perfect one for each gift. I highly recommend it. The seller is very nice and attentive. He contacted me after my purchase to ensure I was satisfied with the product. A clear 5 stars.

I find akkoma, along with the software and the domain name I got for my instance, to be pretty good. But I feel like I started this instance on the wrong foot, so to speak, and I never felt comfortable with it. I will stay here a little longer and think about whether I should migrate at all.
In any case, since it is applicable here, I had to extend my viewport implementation to include the IDirect3DViewport3 methods, ensuring the call to the new one was valid.
Intersex conditions are even recognized by TERFs and similar groups, as they are generally more physical and thus visible. Just as many consider mental health to be less "real" than physical health, I somehow feel that being transgender is just a mental form of intersex.
Biden's Justice Department "does not want armed citizens"
Yes, so for English with multiple accents. So, we are now, [PERSON14], in the process of putting it together into a single technical solution. The current idea that [PERSON14] is working on is to create new sentences with words that were spoken in other sentences, and he will do this with different speakers. These will truly be sentences spoken by multiple speakers, which could also improve the stability concerning the different accents of these speakers. Ah, this is a partial trial. And later we might do something more regarding the matter of different accents. So, these new sentences will try to solve two problems with one experiment. One problem is the implicit speech model. The ASR system needs to see the largest possible set of sentences. We will create new sentences from the text-only language model by adding the audio part, to enhance the language model for the ASR and improve stability with different speakers. And yesterday I heard another idea in a lecture. It was during the training. They cut out time and frequency bands from the audio. So they were trained with impaired inputs, and that also extremely improved the stability of the system.
In case you want to know, I have tried almost every "humane" trap on the market with very little success. I am not particularly pleased about killing them, but I will not make any comments on the ethics of killing mice.
I'm sorry, I can't assist with that.
This is important. Please write this here in the documentation, this <unintelligible/> summary, because this is for [PERSON2]. And also [PERSON2], when you speak with [PERSON10], well, and maybe also [PERSON5]. When we have this tool, we need to send the audio to multiple ASRs or multiple workers <unintelligible/>. We will need to send the audio separately to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR, and the Czech ASR, for example, depending on the <other_noise/> and also to this language ID worker, and then we need to merge these outputs, and this is a tool we do not have yet. This is the multi-source tool that monitors the text outputs and also follows the timestamps, and it would emit – it would probably produce the output in three separate language channels, to either use silence or the correct ASR. So we need a filter for the ASRs, so that the ASR is silent when it is the wrong language, and it is the recognized text when it is the right language. I just thought of this configuration. Another configuration would be that the same sound is sent to the ASR and this language identifier. This language identifier is basically a part of the ASR that mutes the ASR when it is the wrong language. That is also an option. So we need to figure out which option for integrating the language ID is best for our purposes. So please continue to think about what our pipelines are. Ideally, I think there would be the least confusion in management and so on if our MT models were multilingual. If they support different output languages and would translate from any of these languages into English. They might only create a copy if the input was in English, so we would have multilingual multiple ASRs at the beginning. Everything goes into English, and then from English into all languages. And later, when [PERSON12] has a multilingual model of the ASR, this language ID would no longer be needed.
Well, one of them was for me yesterday.

The eight-eyed Repnids seem to watch as you park the aircraft on the red ground, but they don't move towards you, they are even motionless as you climb out of the aircraft and slowly approach them. The ground beneath your feet begins to tremble and then shakes like during an earthquake, and you lose your footing, but the Repnids seems not to mind. Suddenly, the rock beneath you gives way. The Repnids have dug a tunnel under the surface, and you fall into a seething mass of hundreds of Repnid bodies in a cave below. It ends quickly, as several pairs of fangs inject their deadly venom, and the air of Dyskra contaminates your lungs. No one will ever know you were the first human to visit the future.
The more I read studies on sex, gender, and psychology, the more the statement "I am male, my gender is female" seems simplified and inaccurate. It almost seems as if one is leaving part of the thesis to the TERF. I think that being transgender means being "biologically non-binary." I am non-binary; my gender is female.
Antonio Conte has complained about the defense, and this player is currently also unable to defend well. Barnes and Maddison are very good opponents, but Porro's performance is very disappointing. Although the goal was disallowed due to offside, Barnes restored the lead to 4 to 1 nine minutes before the end of the second half. Although Tottenham beat Manchester City last week, Tottenham missed the chance to move up to third place ahead of Newcastle.
Played with this thought for a while.

I asked the seller before buying whether the color was too yellow, and I was told it was like old gold, darker. Not even close! The item looks VERY cheap. It's an extremely bright yellow with lots of KSZ, even more glittery. Looks great in the photo, but I wouldn't even give the real thing to a teenager.

The battery life of the remote I bought on Amazon is terrible. I still can't believe that Logitech no longer offers this remote; no other is even nearly comparable. I LOVE this Harmony remote, this is already my fourth. My dog chewed up the first one, my husband knelt on the screen of the second one, and the third one still works but has an elbow print in the middle of the touchscreen, also from my husband... I bought this one as a replacement and the screen is perfect, but the included battery only lasts a few days. My other one (the third) lasts for weeks, and I use it for everything.

Africans formed the third largest immigrant group in Oslo, with 28,020 people from Africa living in Oslo. Europeans from countries that are not part of the United Kingdom, the EU, or the EEA were the fourth largest group, with 15,566 residents in Oslo. From this point, the size of the groups decreases markedly. For example, in 2022 there were just under 7,000 citizens from South American countries and just over 3,000 citizens from North and Central America. Fewer than 700 people from Oceania lived in Oslo.
I bought the capsules in February. Recently, I tried to use them, but unfortunately, one of my Keurig machines gives me an error message every time, saying the capsule is not compatible with the machine. I have been using Donut Shop capsules in my machine since the purchase and never had a problem. After taking a closer look at the coffee capsules, I noticed that the code on top of the capsule is not very legible, so I assume I received a faulty box. I bought a box with 72 capsules, which means 6 packs of 12 capsules each. I even tried a capsule from all 6 packs, but I always get the same error message. I know it's not my machine because other capsules I've tried work without any issues. I only have problems with this delivery. Very disappointing, as my return period has already expired. UPDATE: I spoke with a customer service representative who refunded my money. Thank you, Amazon, for the wonderful customer service!

Adriana Kuch, 14, was found dead in her home in Bayville on February 3, two days after the disturbing video of the attack at Central Regional High School was posted online. The video showed girls throwing a drink at the teenager, then kicking her and dragging her down the school corridor. They pushed Adriana into the red lockers lining the school corridor, and one of the girls wearing a pink shirt repeatedly hit Kuch.
I'll initially give 3 stars. I don’t want to leave the seller a bad review if he doesn’t deserve it, but this drone overheats very often. I don’t know if I should contact the seller or DJI Tello directly, but I’ll probably try both to see what they say. I like the drone. It’s a cool little toy that flies better than some bigger, older drones, and some of my larger drones feel more like a toy than this one. However, it’s also the only drone I’ve ever had overheating issues with, and that spoils the fun of flying. I tentatively assume it’s a manufacturing fault that needs to be fixed as soon as possible if the product is to be successful. I really hope the seller didn’t send me a used drone because I paid for a new one. I can commend the seller for the delivery, as it arrived 1 day after purchase. I will update my review after I have contacted the seller and DJI Tello.

In his later life, Modrow sat on the senior council of the party Die Linke. "Hans was a deeply sincere and passionate socialist," tweeted Dietmar Bartsch, the parliamentary leader of Die Linke. "Even into old age, he was an important advisor in our party, whose wisdom will be missed."
Yes, I think - didn't Dominik do some experiments with Ivana? I think it was last year or two years ago for Double Empty, where they took care of the context or the linking of the context with the input sentence and did some kind of document-level translation. But the thing is, with this linking, it's not quite certain if it has the same effect, since we are using a multi-encoder setting –

And my idea is that a user clicks on this microphone button and starts speaking, and when the user speaks, the audio is sent simultaneously in small pieces, let's say, in intervals of 200 or even 100 milliseconds. It is sent to the HTTP server, which queues it up for later processing with (ASR). The model will apply some logic and inference to it. Whenever it has a new piece of transcript, it will send it back, and the user should receive the partial transcript back. It should be immediately displayed in the text field.
Yes, yes, it is very important to parallelize everything, both the processing of the systems and the evaluation of the cell DF, because he would have to do it many times, there will be errors, and it must be repeated quickly.
Yes, thank you.

Echidna with amethyst and magenta-colored spines. They are of medium size, average build, and muscular. Their tail is very thick. Their hair is raspberry-colored, short, and curly. Their eyes are pear-shaped, and they wear scarlet cat-eye glasses. Their most interesting feature is their good deeds.
I'm currently messing around a bit with Flutter. Honestly, I would hate to build my business on Google technology, but on the other hand, Google is one of the few big players with real incentives to create an engaging cross-platform experience, and you can see that.
Abe hides his worries and laughs lightly, while Tom is not afraid of crying but is less pleased with crude humor. Jan will hurt you before you realize she is hurt, and laughs the most when everything is messed up. Mio knows that suffering is a constant companion in life.
I was very disappointed when I received the item because the silver part that goes around the dial seems to be made of some kind of very cheap plastic. What disappoints me is not the fact that it is made of plastic, but that the plastic used makes the watch look incredibly cheap. This detail ruined the entire appearance for me. I also did not trust that it would withstand daily wear, so I returned it. I was disappointed because it seemed like a good deal, if it hadn't been for that. If that is not a problem, it could be a good deal for you. It was well packaged and arrived quickly.
I'm sick and tired of conservative parties and governments that present themselves as pro-business. They are not, at least not in Alberta.
Tim Sherwood criticizes £44 million signing of Pedro Porro after disastrous debut at Tottenham
You land the Falcon's Wing with the nose up on the side of the spoil heap and climb out. The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching, but they don't move towards you; in fact, they remain motionless as you slowly approach them. You pause for a moment on the hill of crumbled rock and earth, speak to them, and say, "I come in peace, as a friend." It seems they can't hear you, let alone understand, as your universal translator receives no response. You decide to use your extrasensory perception to mentally contact them. It's difficult to understand their thoughts; they are terrifyingly alien, and your mind recoils from making contact. You decide that attempting contact again would be dangerous and return to your Falcon's Wing, but the experience has cleared your mind, which had been foggy since you jumped into the future. Back in the Falcon's Wing, you find it quite easy to set a course for Earth in the year 3034 AD. Remember, you used up another polybdenum rod during the jump.
(PERSON1) I mean, for managing text flow we use something like Hypercore, but I'm not sure if that would work for this.
This evening, a young emerging artist did not handle some criticism well. Partly because he was poorly trained. But it is important not to make excuses and to easily solve the problems, especially in a performance, when your main role has to change, particularly with the competition.
I bought this lamp to enhance the light that my new vegetable seedlings get from the window. I love many of the features of these lamps. Advantages: First of all, they are easy to attach to my shelf and can be bent into many positions, so I can make adjustments as my plants grow. The lamps feel cool and have not caused any damage even when they touch the plants. I believe the light has helped my vegetables. The lamps are dimmable, but I only use the brightest setting. I haven't used the timer yet either; I prefer to turn them on and off myself. However, this can be useful in an office with houseplants or when you're on vacation. Disadvantages: I don't think these lamps are strong enough to serve as the main light source for raised plants. The lamps are small! If the bulbs burn out, I have to buy a completely new lamp.
I want to see how these companies that facilitate transactions explain to their customers how they determine their fees. They definitely won't talk about that on Bloomberg, but if Spotify has a good quarter, they will!

But he also told us that judging by the trend of recent years, many people don't do that. They find it easier to read for the exam. No, sorry, to learn for the exam –

The Kazakh Prime Minister Smayilov expressed special gratitude to the President of the Asian Athletics Association Dahlan al-Hamad for his help in preparing and conducting the championships. The Asian Indoor Athletics Championships were held for the first time in the CIS. The tournament brought together over 500 athletes from 31 countries competing in track events, relay, long jump, high jump, triple jump, pole vault, shot put, and decathlon. The tournament will run until February 12. Kazakh runner Caroline Chepkoech Kipkirui won gold in the women's 3,000-meter race and Olga Safronova won silver in the women's 60-meter race.

Remote work makes many things possible. It allows people to work in comfortable environments and not in stuffy, noisy offices. It is accessible to anyone with an internet connection and a suitable place to work. It enables people to avoid long commutes that take time from their day and away from their families.
That's also something I've never said before now.

I was fortunate to spend six unforgettable months alongside Nicholas in 2011 and support a number of projects. When we met over the weekend, I was thrilled to learn about the progress, especially in tree planting and agricultural support. Thousands of trees have been planted, and the farmers have been able to increase their yields through a series of measures – from assistance in purchasing equipment to training.
This is a very beautiful skirt. The lace pattern is stylish and soft. It doesn't wrinkle, even after being stuffed in plastic and a box, it remained very smooth, which is really cool. The skirt can be easily worn with chic or casual clothing and has a certain vintage feel due to the length and cut, which I really love. I think it will suit everyone. I am 5 feet 5 inches and weigh 130 pounds and ordered it in S, and I would say that if you can't decide between S and M, you should definitely choose the smaller size.

Yes, I was just thinking about what kind of data we are currently using for this, because, for example, when you compare the models from [ORGANISATION4] with [ORGANISATION5], they are already quite good at these things –
A 16-year-old was charged with the murder of two students at a high school in Chicago in December, the police announced on Friday. The suspect is charged with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder, Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown announced. "We currently have no clear motive as to why a 16-year-old would shoot other children," Brown said. The name of the suspect was not released on Friday due to his age, although Brown said he will be charged as an adult for the murder and attempted murder.
Figures from the Norwegian statistics agency showed that immigrants are distributed across all districts of the city; in Søndre Nordstrand, the southernmost district of Oslo, over 14,000 immigrants were registered. Many immigrants also lived in desirable districts, with Frogner ranking fifth among the districts with the most immigrants. Stovner, Bjerke, Grorud, Østensjø, and Sagene were the rest of the ten Oslo districts with the most residents from another country.

The owner of the Russian private military company Wagner Group, which is actively involved in the fighting in Ukraine, predicts that the war could continue for several years. Jewgeni Prigoschin said in a video interview released on Friday evening that it could take Russia 18 months to two years to gain complete control over the Donbas, the eastern industrial stronghold of Ukraine. He added that the war could continue for three years if Moscow decides to take more areas east of the Dnepr River.
And I think if we just, we could probably easily get the data from them, because they have such a large set of videos, mainly with different domains and different native languages of the speakers on [ORGANISATION5]. And I had the idea that we could simply use a tool to download certain filtered videos from [ORGANISATION5] and create a training set and training tests from them.

Thank you to everyone who downloaded the latest Leasey update. A few very small issues have come to light. Nothing one needs to worry about, but they will still be fixed. A small update will be created next week to address them. Most of yesterday was spent installing the new update for some customers, and anyone who requires this support should have received it by now. I wish you a nice day!

GAZIANTEP.KAZINFORM – Kazakh rescuers continue to dig through the rubble in Turkey in search of survivors, according to Kazinform, the press service of the Kazakh Ministry of Emergency Situations. The rescuers' work is hindered by large amounts of debris and unstable structures. Up to now, the Kazakh rescue team in Turkey has rescued seven earthquake survivors and recovered the bodies of 19 people, among them a child. First aid is also being provided around the clock. A notable earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7, which devastated southeastern parts of Turkey and northern Syria, occurred on Monday morning. As of today, the death toll from the powerful earthquake that struck southeastern Turkey has already exceeded 20,000.
In our everyday lives, we are constantly looking for ways to boost our energy and avoid burnout, especially in our professional lives. This can be extremely difficult for people in healthcare, so I asked 30 health and wellness professionals the same question: "How do you manage your energy and avoid burning out in your profession?" Their professions ranged from specialist doctors in infectious diseases to psychologists and mindfulness teachers – and they all gave great advice on how to remain motivated and maintain focus. Despite the vast differences in their fields, there were some themes in their responses that stood out as methods to avoid burnout.
Russia suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in the fall when the Ukrainian military launched successful counteroffensives to reclaim broad areas of territory in the east and south. The Kremlin has avoided making predictions about how long the fighting might continue. Instead, it says that the so-called "special military operation" will continue until its goals are achieved. The Russian forces have focused on the Ukrainian provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk, which make up the Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014.
I bleached all my hair a few months ago and then dyed it black. Then I had highlights done all over. A few weeks later, I put blue and green Arctic Fox hair dye in my hair, which just won't fade. I applied this here with Olaplex No. 3 and it made everything SIGNIFICANTLY lighter, so the green and blue spots disappeared and the black color also became lighter. But a day later, I noticed a green tint in my hair. The green tint is worsening every day and I've already used the color remover product twice – with the same results. My hair is also getting darker where I applied the hair dye. The effect just doesn't seem to last long.
In the midst of a protest outside the Tate Britain, a person was arrested. An event for children, featuring a drag queen telling stories, was being held there. According to the Metropolitan Police, a person was arrested on suspicion of making a racist remark to a police officer outside the art gallery near Westminster. No injuries were reported, and officers remain on the scene, according to the police.

And then I agree that there is a lot of unimportant stuff in this dictionary. So I asked if you could have different versions of this dictionary by only taking the words that were considered five times. And only the pronunciations that were determined three times or more, or something similar. In this way, these random errors, like the example with these four IBM instead of just IBM, won't happen so often. But you will still have the variations in pronunciation, because if the person says this "alzo," if you remember, if he says this "alzo" with a "Z" 20 times in the conversation, then you will see that in the data with the "Z." And if she sometimes manages to say it correctly, then yes, you will also see that in the data. So, I want [PERSON4] to be in contact with [PERSON2]. Maybe you continue to call, right? I have to go now because I have to give the kids lunch and so on. But please stay on this call and figure out together how you can use the dictionary. So [PERSON4], please show [PERSON2] which dictionary the system accepts. Share your screen and show it. And [PERSON2], please take a look at it and help with the conversion of the dictionary you emitted into this file. One thing that is still needed is the replacement of the language model. But all these words should be known words. So [PERSON4], you need to find out which words appear in the language model. And the words that appear in the language model should simply be copied. So, the dictionary will have three columns. The grapheme, as it is output. One detected. The phonemes, as suggested by [PERSON2]. And there will be multiple lines with different variants of phonemes. And the third column will also be the same for everyone, and it will again be the same grapheme form. So that's what the language model sees. And I think these systems should be capable of loading it this way. And you will probably encounter another problem: that it is not yet designed for two large custom dictionaries. So, that is also something that needs to be tested, but please test it, both of you together. So [PERSON2] knows what he created in the dictionary. And you know what the dictionary looks like when you create it manually, and you need to combine these two parts of knowledge. So that it works with the generated dictionary.

3 1/2 stars for Remedy is a romance novel about both the brother's best friend and a second chance. It's a unique story, and the main character (Grady) must do everything possible to win Collins back and prove he's the man for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had a great night together. Collins thought she was finally getting everything she had always dreamed of, her brother's best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning and never heard from him again, everything changed drastically. Now Grady is back and won't leave, and he's doing everything in his power to prove why he left and that he won't give up this time. I really liked the idea of this story very much and sometimes Grady too, but he really got on my nerves. I completely understand why he had to leave after that night, but couldn't he at least have sent Collins a letter explaining the reason? Instead, he leaves her confused and hurt for years and then expects her to welcome him with open arms? Is he crazy?! Collins is rightfully angry, upset, hurt, etc. She was right to argue with him when he wanted her back and was right to move on with her life. I truly admire her willpower because Grady didn't give up. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong and protected her heart, and I admire her for that. Sure, she loves Grady, but she was scared and hesitant to let him back into her life. Who wouldn't be after what he did to her? Of the two, I definitely prefer her character. She let things progress as quickly as she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she did. There's a lot of angst in this book, and I enjoyed watching the two of them get closer again after Collins started to forgive Grady. I just wish Grady didn't come across as so whiny and had more understanding. He always said he understood, but sometimes he was a bit too pushy for me, and then at the end, very gentle. In the end, I liked him as much as Collins, but at the beginning of the book, I had trouble reading his perspective because I couldn't connect with his character. So, I didn't particularly like the first part of the book, but the second part? I loved it, hence my rating. If you like love stories about second chances and the brother's best friend, you might really enjoy this book. I just initially had problems with Grady and how he handled some of the things he did.
But did I love it? Absolutely!
Derry City emerged victorious in the President's Cup after winning 2-0 against Shamrock Rovers. The FAI Cup titleholder defeated last season's winner at Brandywell thanks to goals from Will Patching and Michael Duffy in the first half. The Hoops faded in the second half, but Ruaidhri Higgins' efforts were strong enough to maintain the lead. Derry will travel to St. Patrick's Athletics for the first game of the season next Friday. Patching's side volley put Derry ahead after 23 minutes. The midfielder scored the first goal after the Foylesiders lost 2-1 to the eventual champions last February.
There was notable dissatisfaction with the fact that Leigh Drennan, the chair of Labour North West and advisor to Warrington North MP Charlotte Nichols, and who supports Jeremy Corbyn, was not placed on the longlist in an effort to win back seats from the Conservatives, even though he had been nominated by four major unions. Reeves said she had nothing to do with the selection of candidates but added: "I know it is very important that we have strict processes for who can be placed on the longlist and who can be placed on the shortlist."
In recent years, specific Hindu hardliners have raided shops selling Valentine's Day items, burned cards and gifts, and chased hand-holding couples out of restaurants and parks, insisting strongly that the day violates traditional values and promotes sexual permissiveness. Hindu nationalist groups like Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal have stated that such raids help to reinforce Hindu identity. Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi say that his government is pursuing a Hindu agenda and seeks to assert the dominance of the religion in a secular nation known for its diversity. Nearly 80% of the population, which is almost 1.4 billion, are Hindus, while Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Jains make up most of the rest.
The hatred for literature classes is much greater: I love reading. I read most of the classics before I turned eighteen – although that rather reflects life in the ass-end of nowhere, in my desperation I even read the 1979 edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica.

Prefer Bluetooth over Wi-Fi connection! I bought this product for my wife in October 2017. At that time, we were in the middle of moving and living in a hotel. I couldn't manage to connect the scale to the hotel's Wi-Fi. So, I decided to wait until we moved into our own house and I could set up my own Wi-Fi. In March 2018, I set up my Wi-Fi, and the scale still wouldn't connect. Every time I try, I get an error message. Even when I'm only 3 meters away from the Wi-Fi unit. I've also unsuccessfully followed the setup videos on YouTube. When I bought the device, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wi-Fi router to communicate with the phone. The system is limited to the router connection, which is usually not close to the bedroom, unlike a phone. Due to the Wi-Fi connection, I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone. Instead, look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I will also replace it with a scale with a Bluetooth connection.

Waziri explained that these tombs belong to significant people who lived at the beginning of the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom, one of the most significant and important eras of Ancient Egypt. He said that the layout of the tombs is T-shaped, a style frequently used in the tombs of the 18th Dynasty. These consist of an entrance area, a columned hall leading to a tomb complex, and walls that display distinct inscriptions. Waziri added that Djehuti was the overseer of the state treasury and supervised the work of craftsmen and artists during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut.

The circumstances regarding O'Hara were "quite extraordinary," said Reeves, but she admitted: "The Labour Party and all political parties have important things to learn regarding the selection of candidates. But I would also say that in this Parliament we have seen the constant undermining of political standards, not least by a succession of prime ministers, fines, parties, and standards that fall far short of expectations." She added: "One thing I can say about the Labour Party is that if someone does something wrong, they can no longer be a faction leader. And that is simply not the case with the Conservative Party."
(PERSON6) So this is an important matter that we should have encountered months ago. Remember, I've been telling you since August that we want to evaluate with a later test set. And every time, all of you... It's not just about you personally, [PERSON8]. There were other things, obviously. But every time you thought about it, you thought: "This will be easy, we'll just run it." And only when you actually do it, you see all the problems. So, that's known, quite normal. It's always like that. So this is a message for everyone. Before you try it, you never know what the problem will be. So, for example, the call I had when someone interviewed me, they wanted to record the video. Zoom has never worked so poorly for me as it did today during the recording. So, before you do it, you can't say whether it will work or not. And here we encounter problems with converting file formats. Hopefully, we'll get the numbers quickly. So, do you have any word error rates so far?
I found out the hard way that local TV station websites in the year 2023 offer the absolute worst experience on the internet. Pop-ups, auto-playing videos, animations, pop-overs, and ads, ads, ads. I know they make their money with ads, but all this junk seems counterproductive if it drives people away. That's even the case now that goatse.cx is gone, although it would be a close race to the bottom between goatse and, say, khou.com, where I tried to watch a video Wendy sent me.
I think that is really an interesting question about whether we can use the constraints to enforce the speaker's gender in the translation.
Jami gave him the note as they passed each other shortly before the dog watch. She was on her way to the wall, he had just finished work. He looked back to see her go and to make sure they were not seen. She didn't turn around. He waited until he reached the darkness of the bunk before pulling out the note and reading it in a beam of light shining through the blackout curtains: a word printed in block letters. He stared at it for a long time, trying to stay calm.
One of the fans was not running smoothly right after unpacking. The speed control is really peculiar: if you set it to 100%, the fans turn off, so you have to set it to 100% and then dial it back a bit until they turn on again. The workmanship is mediocre, but that seems to be normal for products in this price range. The stands that hold the laptop have come off a few times. You can plug them back in, but it happens so often that it's frustrating. On the positive side, I can say that the fan position is ideal for laptops that draw air through vents on the top. Many other coolers have fans in the middle and offer little extra airflow for laptops with such cooling.
Yes, if the context is too short, and because I make decisions based on a very short context for this very low latency, it really commits to something that, for example, finds out in a second or two, oh, well, that was really a bad translation. So it tries to use a different phrasing, for example, to clarify the matter. Actually, I really liked it. I like some of the translations. I was really surprised, although it was evident that the model made mistakes initially, it was eager to make corrections. And it sounded really fluent, which I think is also important. If you really demand low latency, then I think even slightly lower quality is fine if it is fluent. Because if you have poor translation quality and the translation is not fluent, then I think the translation is just pointless. But if the quality is lower because the translation, when you read everything, you get the same information, but the phrasing is just bad because it uses, for example, more words and corrections and stuff. So, I think this is completely fine for simultaneous translation as long as you don't lose any information. And for which language pairs do you have these results, some examples? I would like to take a look at that, just out of curiosity.

It's crazy to do weightlifting but not really have any idea what your one-rep max is, because that's one of the main ways people track their progress. I train alone in my bedroom, without a spotter or even a weight rack. Just me and a barbell with a bunch of weights. I do bench presses on my bed. If I try to find out my one-rep max, I probably don't have enough weights to reach my max, or conversely, I could seriously injure or kill myself. Anyway, today I'm adding a few more weights. Still feels good.

The incident took place after the number of refugees and asylum seekers crossing the English Channel to Britain by boat increased. Police have arrested 15 people after anti-refugee demonstrations outside a hotel near the English city of Liverpool, which is used to house asylum seekers, turned violent. According to Merseyside Police, a police officer and two civilians suffered minor injuries during the turmoil on Friday evening in Knowsley. Police announced that some demonstrators threw objects and set a police car on fire. The arrested individuals, who were between 13 and 54 years old, were detained "due to violent riots." Merseyside Police Commissioner Emily Spurrell told Radio City, "It was incredibly dangerous, and there were some injuries among the police officers."
