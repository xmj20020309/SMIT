For Interspeech, we could also split it up paper by paper. So that some papers would go into the Interspeech proceedings. And some of our submitted papers would later appear in the PBML proceedings. And the authors could choose freely. So we have to negotiate this either with SIGDial or with Interspeech. Whether it is okay for them to get some of our papers, as these papers will be submitted by the March deadline. So there is a very strict requirement. And I think they can't have anything against it. Because if the paper is worth publishing. It is only a plus point that the paper has a result of a joint task that appears in the satellite event. So yes, I think it's okay. So we don't have to ask for a special session. At Interspeech it's called a special session, we don't want that. At Interspeech we want the satellite event. But we will tell our people. If you have your paper ready by the Interspeech deadline, send it as an Interspeech paper and you have it within Interspeech. Ah, if you don't make it, ah, by the Interspeech deadline, here is our deadline. And that's for PBML.

Donald Trump's heavily mortgaged skyscraper at 40 Wall Street is under "special scrutiny" amid falling income and rising costs, Bloomberg reported Friday. The vacancy rate at the 72-story building, Trump's most valuable asset, jumped to nearly 18% in the third quarter of last year, according to a monthly filing on the remaining $126.5 million mortgage, Bloomberg reported. Expenses have reportedly risen 11% since the mortgage began in 2015. Trump has often boasted about the building, which he acquired in 1995 and which was valued at $540 million in 2015.  
I really liked this ring - but I couldn't wear it all the time! :( This ring was very beautiful. I liked the design and how heavy it felt; it looked expensive and fit very comfortably! The only reason I'm only giving it 3 stars and ultimately returning it is because I realized I wouldn't be able to wear it all the time. I like to wear my rings continuously, which is why I always make sure to buy sterling silver ones. I know some people have said their rings tarnished after a while, but I wore mine for a week straight - even when washing my hands - and couldn't see any tarnishing. The problem I had, interestingly, was that the inside of the ring made my finger white and damp - kind of like when you wear a bandage for a long time. This happened even when I made sure both my ring and finger were completely dry. I don't know why this happened, and it's never happened with any other ring, but I didn't feel comfortable with it and so decided this ring wasn't the right one for me. :( Too bad, because I really liked it! So if you're buying this ring because you want to wear it occasionally, I highly recommend it!! You won't be disappointed!  
Oh yes, I just don't know if you, if you <unintelligible/> got it when we talked about [PERSON1], but one thing is that the (inflection) is better, but the other thing is that the lemmas are really manually inflected, but that's, that's another, no, no problem, it's even good that <unintelligible/> is correct, yes. So, I thought it might be. But I'm not sure if we have some test data for it, but we could try playing around with the models, with some kind of style transfer? As you know, we can use a constraint and try to use a synonymous constraint instead to see or compare how, how, what the difference is between the outputs. But that's, I'm just describing it vaguely because I don't have a clear idea myself of how to do it, but it could have been an interesting, different scenario. I don't know, [PERSON1], do you know anything about style transfer data for English-Czech? Do we have anything there?

At the other end of the spectrum, only 184 foreign residents called Marka home, and just over 700 lived in the city center. Ullern, Vestre Aker, and Nordstrand were the other districts with the fewest foreign residents. However, Ullern, Vestre Aker, and Nordstrand had more immigrants than Oslo city center and Marka. Immigrants from EU, EEA, and UK countries mostly lived in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Old Oslo, and St. Hanshaugen. While many immigrants from Asia, including Turkey, also lived in Old Oslo (5,837), the majority were registered in the districts of Alna, Stovner, and Søndre Nordstrand.

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources came to the rescue of a very unlucky bear after it became trapped in a ditch. The bear had been hibernating in a culvert along the road near Wannaska, Minnesota, according to a Facebook post from the department. But as the snow began to melt, the water level in the culvert rose and the bear became trapped in deep snow and ice, the department said. Department staff responded quickly and helped the bear escape. The department's bear biologist, Andrew Tri, "examined the bear and declared it healthy but lethargic – apparently from being roused from its hibernation," the Facebook post said. The department then transported the bear to a state wildlife management area so it could continue its hibernation. The weary predator was estimated to be 6 years old and weigh between 375 and 400 pounds.

Modrow, a communist reformer, took over the leadership of the GDR shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall and later invited opposition parties into the government. However, he was unable to slow down the increasing momentum of German reunification. "The peaceful establishment of German unity was a particular achievement of his," wrote Die Linke on Twitter. "That will remain his political legacy." In the 16 years, starting in 1973 as head of the Communist Party in Dresden, Modrow made a name for himself as an anti-establishment figure. He rejected party privileges and insisted on living in a normal apartment.

A pedestrian has died following a collision with a car in Fife. The 38-year-old woman was taken by ambulance to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy after the accident on Broad Street in Cowdenbeath at approximately 1:30 pm on Friday. A 24-year-old man was subsequently arrested in connection with the collision. Police are appealing for witnesses or motorists with dashcams who may have filmed the collision to come forward. Sergeant Lee Walkingshaw said: "Our enquiries are ongoing and we would urge anyone who was in the vicinity of the incident and witnessed the collision, or motorists with dashcam footage which could assist our investigation, to contact us. Anyone who can help is asked to call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 1638, along with the date of the incident, Friday, 10 February 2023."  
"Excuse me, what? A friend had recommended me the mask of this brand, so I bought it, the conditioner and the all-in-one milk. I can't say if the product works because the smell was simply unbearable. Do you know that musty smell that old buildings use in women's restrooms to cover up the smell of *ladies*, which then just ends up being a sour, chemical, musty grandma smell? That's the only thing I can think of when I smell it. But there's no accounting for taste, maybe you like the smell. My friend said that it helps even the most damaged hair, so if you don't mind the smell, don't worry. I know that natural products don't smell as good as synthetic ones, but I have the feeling that more and more natural brands don't care anymore because it sells anyway and that's why everything smells like playdough now. I've had to give up many of my favorite brands because the formula has been changed to cheaper ingredients. I don't know if that was the case here or if it's a fake (I called Davines and they said no), but it smells DISGUSTING and I had to return it."
The news that Special Prosecutor Jack Smith has subpoenaed Mike Pence raises the following question: How will the Trump team use the courts to thwart this latest development in the Justice Department's investigation? The short answer is that any attempt to block Pence's subpoena by invoking executive privilege is likely to fail. First, there is the question of whether a former president can even claim the privilege. Recall that Trump unsuccessfully tried to prevent the January 6th Select Committee from obtaining White House records.

The tombs of Djehuti and Hery were inaugurated on Thursday after the completion of restoration work. The inauguration was carried out by the Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities of Egypt, Mostafa Waziri, the Spanish Ambassador to Egypt, Alvaro Iranzo, and the President of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Eloísa del Pino. Waziri explained that the two tombs were discovered during a joint Egyptian-Spanish archaeological mission by the Supreme Council of Antiquities and the CSIC, which have been collaborating since 2002. He said that the mission carried out excavation and restoration work and published research on the tombs, which are located in the Dra Abu al-Naga region on the west bank of the Nile in Luxor. Their work uncovered numerous tombs, coffins, mummies, and a burial garden.

For the upcoming meetings, I inquired about the demand because I saw the (meme) project demo. They do offline subtitling, which is a bit simpler than what we do. They still have the same problems with segmentation and so on. However, their translation task is shortening, simply because the data is always getting shorter. This is because their target size is the subtitles that are created for people with hearing loss. So there is something like a natural shortening in the data. It would be great if we could also find such kind of data where natural shortening takes place. We would integrate it into the architecture.

(PERSON8) I tried it, I think with two tokens, and yes, because in the first version we suspected that the token itself could also be tokenized, so I repeated it with another token that was not specifically designed for this purpose. This is because we were using a learned dictionary, and this dictionary did not contain separation tokens. So I used a token that I assumed would not be tokenized into multiple parts and would therefore only appear once. I had no certainty that this token could not appear elsewhere in the sentence, and that is the only place where it could appear. So it could be done better, yes, I agree.

## Final English Translation:  In your case, the source of confusion is the [specific action or event].   **Explanation:**  This translation addresses the identified defects in the original target sentence:  * **Accuracy:** It accurately translates "Verwirrende Handlung" as "source of confusion" and includes the specific action or event causing the confusion. * **Fluency:** It rephrases the sentence fragment into a complete sentence with a natural flow. * **Terminology:** It clarifies the type of case by using the phrase "In your case".  This revised translation is more accurate, fluent, and consistent with the source text.  
The controller has a slimmer design that fits better in the hand and has no sharp corners to snag on. With the permanently attached power cord, it won't get damaged as quickly as the original XB1 controller. The downsides are: 1) The vibration effect, which is triggered in action games, feels significantly weaker. 2) The directional joystick and the buttons of the controller wear out quickly. We play quite forcefully and need 2-3 controllers a year. So, if we invest in controllers annually, we have to be selective and take good care of which ones we buy. The controller could benefit from more solid springs, because after only a few months the buttons that are used the most no longer respond and the right joystick no longer stays in the center, so it suddenly zooms in on overview maps or makes characters run forward without touching the controls.

As she further explained, there is a strategy behind this that most people inside the Beltway would consider crazy: This is the best way to win the trust of the press. The press knows that we are not lying like everyone else. SIGTARP will quickly become the only credible source of information in Washington about TARP. Occasionally we may be embarrassed and say something that we could easily sweep under the rug - and others would do so - but we shock the press with our honesty. No one else does that, and sooner or later we have built our own defense when we are attacked. No matter what the press hears, they will always come to us first and believe us because we prove to them that we are telling the truth. This is perhaps the most important reason for Biden to take the path of radical accountability: There will always be moments in every presidency when it is important to have the trust of the public and the institutions that protect the interests of citizens. In addition, important capital can be gained when we stand by our mistakes, and here Biden can make an important difference from his political opponents. The President would do well to follow the old saying: Tell the truth - and shame the devil.  
Forget me, okay. Ignore me, okay. It hurts, but you have to do it.  
(PERSON1) Yes, because I think it's a method that's very easy to test, and it should always be tested against the two encoders. I would expect it to sometimes perform better and sometimes worse than the two encoders, depending on the exact task, so what exactly the second thing is that you're encoding. So if you have two copies, two rephrasings of the same sentence, it might be kind of confusing for the attention, whatever, I don't know. The behavior could also be different with the old sequence-to-sequence methods compared to the transformer, so with RNN it behaves differently then, maybe it's harder to train with the transformer, so you might have to increase the number of warm-ups, the warm-up sentences.

Yes, also for English with multiple accents. So, we are now, [PERSON14], in the process of putting this together into a single technical solution. The current idea that [PERSON14] is working on is that he creates new sentences with words that were spoken in other sentences, and he will do this with different speakers. So it will really be sentences spoken by multiple speakers, and thus the stability regarding the different accents of these speakers could also be improved. Ah, so this is a partial attempt. And later we might do something more about the thing with the different accents. So, these new sentences will try to solve two problems with one experiment. One problem is the implicit language model. So the ASR system needs to see the largest possible set of sentences. And we will create new sentences from the text-only language model by adding the sound part, so that the language model for the ASR is better and also the stability with different speakers is improved. And yesterday I heard another idea in a lecture. It was during the training. They cut out time and frequency bands from the sound. So they were trained with impaired inputs, and that also improved the stability of the system extremely.  
(If you want to know, I've tried pretty much every "humane" trap on
(PERSON4) I believe only two or three sentences were correctly inflected in the wrong context, as if the translation were wrong. And then there are some cases where the translation was completely wrong because the sentence was really wrong, and the part has to be <unintelligible/>, but that was only the case once or twice.  
(PERSON11) This is important. Please write this down in the documentation, this <unintelligible> summary, because it's for [PERSON2]. And also [PERSON2], when you talk to [PERSON10], well, maybe [PERSON5] too. If we have this tool, we need to send the audio to multiple ASRs or multiple workers <unintelligible>. We will have to send the audio separately to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR and the Czech ASR, for example depending on the <other noise> and also to this language ID worker, and then we need to merge these outputs, and this is a tool that we don't have yet. This is the multi-source tool that monitors the text outputs and also follows the timestamps, and it would emit - it would probably produce the output in three separate language channels, to use either silence or the correct ASR. So we need a filter for the ASRs, so that the ASR is silent when it is the wrong language, and it is the recognized text when it is the correct language. I just came up with this kind of configuration. Another configuration would be that the same sound is sent to the ASR and this language checker. This language checker is basically a part of the ASR that mutes the ASR when it is the wrong language. That is also an option. So we need to figure out which way of integrating language ID is best for our purposes. So please keep thinking about what our pipelines are. Ideally, I think there would be the least confusion in management and so on if our MÜ models were multilingual. If they supported different output languages and translated from any of these languages into English. They might only create a copy if the input was in English, so we would have multilingual multiple ASRs at the beginning. Everything goes into English, and then from English into all languages. And later, when [PERSON12] has a multilingual model of the ASR, this language ID would no longer be needed.  
Well, one of them was for me yesterday.

"Antonio Conte has complained about the defense, and this player is currently not doing well in defense either.

Although Tottenham beat Manchester City last week, Tottenham missed the chance to move ahead of Newcastle into third place."

I'm giving 3 stars for now. I don't want to leave the seller a bad review if they don't deserve it, but this drone overheats very often. I don't know if I should contact the seller or DJI Tello directly, but I'll probably try both to see what they say. I like the drone, it's a cool little toy that flies better than some bigger, older drones, and some of my bigger drones feel more like a toy than this one. However, it's also the only drone I've ever had problems with overheating, and that spoils the fun of flying. I'm assuming for now that this is a manufacturing defect that needs to be fixed as soon as possible if the product is to be successful. I really hope the seller didn't send me a used drone because I paid for a new one. One thing I can praise the seller for is the delivery, as it arrived 1 day after purchase.

In his later life, Modrow served on the Council of Elders of the Left Party. "Hans was a deeply sincere and combative socialist," tweeted Dietmar Bartsch, the Left's parliamentary group leader. "Until his old age, he was an important advisor in our party, whose wisdom will be missed."  
Yes, I think - didn't Dominik do some experiments with Ivana?

This sports facility with space for over six thousand people is a clear proof of this," the letter from the Kazakh President said. Kazakh athletes successfully participate in major global sporting events, representing Kazakhstan. They are an example for a growing generation and inspire young people to achieve great success, Tokayev noted. He expressed confidence that hosting the Asian Championships in Astana will give new impetus to the development of athletics in the country and called for better cooperation with international organizations in this area.

My idea is that a customer clicks on this microphone button and starts speaking, and when the user speaks, the audio is sent simultaneously in small chunks. Let's say 200 or even 100 milliseconds. And to the HTTP server, which puts it in a queue that I will later process with (ASR). And the model will do some logic, some inference with it. And whenever it has a new piece of transcript, it will send it back to the user, and the user should receive the partial transcript. And it should be displayed immediately in the text field.

I was very disappointed when I received the item because the silver part that goes around the dial seems to be made of a very cheap plastic. What disappoints me is not the fact that it is made of plastic, but that the plastic used makes the watch look incredibly cheap. This detail completely ruined the look for me. I also didn't trust it to withstand daily wear and tear, so I sent it back. I was disappointed because it seemed like a good deal if it hadn't been for that. If that's not a problem for you, this could be a good deal for you. It was well packaged and arrived quickly.

I bought this lamp to amplify the light that my new vegetable seedlings get from the window. I love many of the features of these lamps. Advantages: First of all, they are easy to attach to my shelf and bend into many positions, so I can make changes as my plants grow. The lights remain cool to the touch and haven't caused any damage even when they've brushed against the plants. I believe that the light has helped my vegetables. The lights are dimmable, but I only use the brightest setting. I haven't used the timer yet, I prefer to turn it on and off myself. But this could be useful in an office with houseplants or when you are on vacation. Disadvantages: I don't think these lights are strong enough to be the main light source for growing plants. The lights are small! If the bulbs burn out, I have to buy a whole new lamp.

The Kazakh Prime Minister Smajylov expressed special gratitude to the President of the Asian Athletics Association Dahlan al-Hamad for his assistance in the preparation and conduct of the championships. The Asian Indoor Athletics Championships were held for the first time in the Commonwealth of Independent States. The tournament brought together over 500 athletes from 31 countries, who competed in running, relay, long jump, high jump, triple jump, pole vault, shot put and decathlon. The tournament will run until February 12. Earlier it was reported that at the tournament the Kazakh runner Caroline Chepkoech Kipkirui won gold in the women's 3,000m race and Olga Safronova won silver in the women's 60m race.

I was fortunate enough to spend six unforgettable months with Nicholas in 2011, supporting a number of projects.

This is a very beautiful skirt. The lace trim is stylish and soft. It doesn't wrinkle, even after being stuffed in plastic and a cardboard box. It was still very smooth, which is really cool.

A 16-year-old has been charged with murder in the fatal shootings of two students at a Chicago high school in December, police said Friday. The suspect is charged with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder, Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown said. "We currently have no clear motive as to why a 16-year-old would shoot other children," Brown added. The suspect's name was not released Friday due to his age, although Brown said he will be charged as an adult with the murder and attempted murder.  
Figures from the Norwegian Statistics Bureau showed that foreigners are spread across all districts of the city, with over 14,000 immigrants registered in Søndre Nordstrand, Oslo's southernmost district.

Stovner, Bjerke, Grorud, Østensjø and Sagene were the remaining five of Oslo's ten districts with the most residents from another country.

The owner of the Russian private military company Wagner Group, which is actively involved in the fighting in Ukraine, predicts that the war could go on for years. Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video interview released on Friday evening that it could take Russia between 18 months and two years to gain full control of the Donbas, Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland. He added that the war could go on for three years if Moscow decides to take more territory east of the Dnieper River.

This information could be added if it is relevant to the context. * The target text does not specify the location of the tombs. This information could be added if it is important to the reader.  
## GAZIANTEP.KAZINFORM – Kazakh rescuers continue to dig through the rubble in Turkey in search of survivors, according to the press service of the Kazakh Ministry of Emergency Situations. The rescuers' work is hampered by large amounts of debris and unstable buildings. To date, the Kazakh rescue team has recovered seven earthquake survivors and the bodies of 19 people, including a child, in Turkey. First aid is also being provided around the clock. A major earthquake of magnitude 7.7, which devastated southeastern Turkey and northern Syria, occurred on Monday morning. To date, the death toll from the powerful earthquake that struck southeastern Turkey has already exceeded 20,000.  
## Final English Translation:  In our daily lives, we constantly seek ways to boost our energy and avoid burnout, especially in our jobs. This can be extremely challenging for healthcare professionals, which is why I asked 30 healthcare and wellness professionals the same question: "How do you manage to divide your energy and not burn out in your profession?" Their professions ranged from infectious disease specialists to psychologists and mindfulness teachers – and they all offered great advice on staying motivated and on track. Despite the wide range of their activities, some common themes emerged in their answers as methods to avoid burnout.  
## Final English Translation:  Russia suffered a series of devastating setbacks in the fall as the Ukrainian military launched successful counteroffensives to retake large swaths of territory in the east and south. The Kremlin has avoided making predictions about how long the fighting could continue, instead saying that the so-called "special military operation" will continue until its goals are achieved. Russian forces have focused on the Ukrainian provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk, which make up the Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014.  
My case: I bleached all my hair a few months ago and then dyed it black. Then I had highlights added all over. A few weeks later I applied blue and green Arctic Fox hair dye to my hair, which just won't fade. I used Olaplex No. 3 with the hair dye and it made everything MUCH lighter, so the green and blue areas disappeared and the black color also became lighter. But a day later I noticed a green tint in my hair. It's getting worse every day and I've already used the hair dye remover twice - with the same results. My hair is also getting darker where I applied the hair dye. It's a great product, it just doesn't seem to last long.

And then I agree that there is a lot of unimportant stuff in this dictionary. So I asked if you could have different versions of this dictionary by just taking the words that were considered, five times. And only the pronunciations that were found three times or more, or something like that. So, in this way, these random errors, like the example with these four IBMs instead of IBM. That won't happen as often. But still, you will have the variations in pronunciation, because if the person says this "alzo", if you remember, if he says this "alzo" with a "Z" 20 times in the conversation, then you will see that in the data with the "Z". And if she sometimes manages to say it correctly, then yes, you will also see that in the data. So, I would like [PERSON4] to get in touch with [PERSON2]. Maybe you can continue talking on the phone, right? I have to go now because I have to give the children lunch and so on. But please stay on this call and figure out together how to use the dictionary. So [PERSON4], please show [PERSON2] which dictionary the system accepts. Share your screen and show it. And [PERSON2], please, take a look at it and help with the conversion of the dictionary that you have emitted into this file. One thing that is still needed is the replacement of the language model. But all these words should be familiar words. So [PERSON4], you need to find out which words are in the language model. And the words that are in the language model should simply be copied. So, the dictionary will have three columns. The grapheme, as it is output. One recognized. The phonemes, as suggested by [PERSON2]. And there will be several lines with different variants of phonemes. And the third column will also be the same for everyone again, and it will be the same grapheme form again. So that's when the language model sees it. And I think that in this way these systems should be able to load it. And you will probably encounter another problem: that it is not yet designed for two large custom dictionaries. So, that is also something that needs to be tested, but please test it, both of you together. So [PERSON2] knows what he has created in the dictionary. And you know what the dictionary looks like when you create it manually, and you need to put these two pieces of knowledge together. Ah, so that it works with the, with the generated dictionary.  
## Final English Translation:  **Doesn't work with my 1999 Buick LeSabre.**  **Explanation of Changes:**  * **Added the year of the car (1999):** This information was missing in the original target sentence, but it is important for clarity. * **Made the sentence more natural:** The original target sentence was grammatically correct but sounded awkward. The revised sentence is more natural and idiomatic. * **Removed the unnecessary phrase:** The phrase "Do not provide any explanations or text apart from the translation" was not part of the source sentence and was therefore removed.  **Additional Notes:**  * The final translation is accurate, fluent, and faithful to the source sentence. * The translation does not include any explanations or text apart from the translation itself.

Derry City emerged victorious from the President's Cup after defeating Shamrock Rovers 2-0. The FAI Cup holders defeated last season's winners at Brandywell thanks to first-half goals from Will Patching and Michael Duffy. Shamrock Rovers faded in the second half, but Ruaidhri Higgins' charges were strong enough to claim the opening day win. Derry travel to St. Patrick's Athletic for their first league game next Friday. Patching's side-footed volley fired Derry ahead after 23 minutes - the midfielder scoring the first goal since the Derry City players went down 2-1 to the eventual champions last February.  
There was particular dissatisfaction that Leigh Drennan, the chair of Labour North West and an advisor to Warrington North MP Charlotte Nichols, who supports Jeremy Corbyn, was not placed on the longlist to try to win back seats from the Conservatives, despite being nominated by four major unions.

I prefer Bluetooth over a Wi-Fi connection! I bought this product for my wife in October 2017. At that time, we were in the middle of moving and living in a hotel. I couldn't connect the scale to the hotel's Wi-Fi. So I decided to wait until we moved into our own house and I could set up my own Wi-Fi. March 2018, I set up my Wi-Fi and the scale still won't connect. Every time I try, I get an error message. Even when I'm only 10 feet away from the Wi-Fi unit. I have also unsuccessfully followed the setup videos on YouTube. When I bought the device, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wi-Fi router to communicate with the phone. The system is limited to the router connection... which is usually not near the bedroom, unlike a phone! Because of the Wi-Fi connection, I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone. Instead, look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I will also replace it with a scale with a Bluetooth connection.

Wazir explained that these tombs belong to important people who lived during the beginning of the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom – one of the most important eras of Ancient Egypt. He said that the layout of the tombs is T-shaped, a style commonly used in tombs of the 18th Dynasty. The tombs consist of an entrance hall, a pillared hall leading to a burial chamber, and walls that display unique inscriptions. Waziri added that Djehuti was the overseer of the treasury and supervised the work of craftsmen and artists during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut.

The circumstances surrounding O'Hara were "quite extraordinary," said Reeves, but she conceded: "The Labour Party and all political parties have important things to learn about candidate selection. But I would also say that we have seen in this Parliament the constant undermining of political standards, not least by a succession of Prime Ministers and fines and parties and standards that fall far short of expectations." She added: "One thing I can say about the Labour Party is that if someone does something wrong, they can no longer be leader of the party. And that is simply not the case with the Conservative Party."  
## Final English Translation:  (PERSON6) So this is an important thing that we should have encountered months ago. Remember, I've been telling you since August that we want to evaluate with a later test set. And every time, all of you... It's not just about you personally, [PERSON8]. There were other things, obviously. But every time you thought about it, you thought, "This will be easy, we'll just run it." And it's not until you actually do it that you see all the problems. So, this is known, quite normal. It's always like this. So this is a message for everyone. Before you try it, you never know what the problem will be. So, for example, the call I had when someone interviewed me, so they wanted to record the video. Zoom has never worked as badly for me as it did today during the recording. So, before you do it, you can't tell if it will work or not. And here we encounter problems with converting the file formats. So hopefully we'll get the numbers soon. So, do you have any word error rates so far?  
I learned the hard way that local TV station websites offer the absolute worst internet experience in 2023. Pop-ups, auto-playing videos, animations, pop-overs, and ads, ads, ads.

This is even true now that goatse.cx is gone, although it would be a close race to the worst between goatse and, say, khou.com, where I tried to watch a video Wendy sent me.  
## Rectified English Translation:  (PERSON3) I think this is a really interesting question, whether we can use the limitations to force this kind of speaker gender in the translation.   ## Explanation of Changes:  * **Added missing information:** The phrase "diese Art von Geschlecht des Sprechers" (this kind of speaker gender) was added to the target text to ensure accuracy. * **Improved fluency:** The target text was expanded to include a complete sentence, making it more natural and readable. * **Maintained faithfulness:** The rectified translation remains faithful to the meaning and intent of the source text.  ## Additional Notes:  * The rectified translation assumes that the limitations mentioned in the source text refer to the limitations of the translation system.  * If the limitations refer to something else, the translation may need to be adjusted accordingly.  
Jami handed him the note as they passed each other just before the dog watch. She was on her way to the wall, he had just finished work. He looked behind him to watch her go and make sure they weren't seen. She didn't turn around. He waited until he was in the darkness of the bunk before he pulled out the note and read it in a ray of light that shone through the blackout curtains. One word printed in block letters. He stared at it for a long time, trying to stay calm.
One of the fans wasn't working properly right out of the box. The speed control is really weird: when you set it to 100%, the fans turn off, so you have to set it to 100% and then back it down a bit until they turn on again. The build quality is mediocre, but that seems to be normal for products in this price range. The stands that hold the laptop have come off a few times already... They can be plugged back in, but it happens so often that it's annoying. On the positive side, I can say that the fan position is ideal for laptops that draw in air through vents on the top of the laptop. Many other coolers have fans in the middle and offer little extra airflow for laptops with such cooling.  
## English Translation:  Yes, if the context is too short, and because I make decisions based on a very short context for this very low latency, then it really commits to something that, for example, finds out in a second or two, oh, well, that was really a bad translation. So it tries to rephrase its output based on feedback. For example, to specify the matter. So, actually I really liked it. I like some of the translations. I was really surprised, although you could see that the model made mistakes on the first try, it really wanted to do some kind of correction. And it sounded very fluent, which I think is also important. If you really demand low latency, then I think even slightly lower quality is okay if it's fluent. Because if you have bad translation quality and the translation is not fluent, then I think the translation is simply pointless. But if the quality is lower because the translation, when you read everything, that you get the same information, but the wording is simply bad, because it uses more words and corrections and things like that. So, I think that this is perfectly fine for simultaneous translation, as long as you don't lose information. And for which language pairs do you have these results, some examples? I would like to take a look at that, just out of curiosity.

It's crazy to do weightlifting but also have no real idea what your one-rep max is, because that's one of the main ways people track their progress.

The incident occurs after a rise in the number of refugees and asylum seekers crossing the English Channel to the UK in boats. Police have arrested 15 people after anti-refugee protests turned violent outside a hotel near the English city of Liverpool, which is being used to house asylum seekers. According to Merseyside Police, one police officer and two civilians sustained minor injuries during the disturbance on Friday evening in Knowsley. Police said some protesters threw objects and set fire to a police van. The arrested people, aged between 13 and 54, were detained "on suspicion of violent disorder." Merseyside Police Commissioner Emily Spurrell told Radio City, "It was incredibly dangerous and there were some injuries to police officers."
