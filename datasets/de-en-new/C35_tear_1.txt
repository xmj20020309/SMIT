I'm not exactly sure why my brain can't figure it out; maybe the tools are just so extensive and vague that my brain simply shuts off due to "too many options."
Because for Interspeech, we could also divide it paper by paper. Some papers would go into the Interspeech proceedings, and some of our submitted papers would appear later in the PBML proceedings. The authors could choose freely. So, we have to negotiate this either with SIGDial or with Interspeech. Whether it's okay for them to get some of our papers, as these papers will be submitted by the March deadline. There is a very strict requirement. And I think they can't have anything against it because if the paper is worth publishing, it's just a plus that the paper has a result of a shared task that appears in the satellite event. So yes, I think it's okay. We don't have to ask for a special session. At Interspeech it's called a special session, we don't want that. At Interspeech we want the satellite event. But we will tell our people: If you have your paper ready by the Interspeech deadline, submit it as an Interspeech paper and you have it within Interspeech. If you don't make it by the Interspeech deadline, here's our deadline. And that's for PBML.
My neighbor and I arrived home at the same time, and I could hear him coughing up a storm due to coronavirus from across the street. So I hurried to get into my apartment to avoid meeting him, but he still managed to catch up with me to chat. I swear that people infected with coronavirus are like zombies trying to infect everyone else.
Yes, well, I mean, I just did the same thing right now.
That would be mainly for surfing the internet, occasionally for emails, and some games.
Okay, so a question just for me, to make sure you insert the token for sentence separation in the linking settings, right? Do you have a special token to distinguish which is the source and which is the context or the other sentence, or do you simply link them without anything? And hope that the system learns it?
Donald Trump's heavily mortgaged skyscraper at 40 Wall Street is under "lender supervision" due to declining income and rising costs, Bloomberg reported on Friday. The vacancy rate of the 72-story building - Trump's most valuable - jumped to nearly 18% in the third quarter of last year, according to a monthly filing on the remaining $126.5 million mortgage, Bloomberg reported. Meanwhile, expenses have reportedly increased by 11% since the start of the mortgage in 2015. Trump has frequently praised the building, which he acquired in 1995 and which was valued at $540 million in 2015.
I really liked this ring – but I couldn't wear it all the time! :( This ring was very beautiful. I liked the design and how heavy it felt; it looked expensive and fit very comfortably! The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars and ultimately sent it back is because I realized I wouldn't be able to wear it all the time. I like to wear my rings continuously, which is why I always make sure to buy rings made of sterling silver. I know some people said their rings had tarnished after a while, but I had worn mine continuously for a week – even while washing my hands – and couldn't detect any tarnishing. Interestingly, the problem I had was that the inside of the ring made my finger white and moist – similar to when you wear a bandage for a long time. This happened even when I made sure both my ring and finger were completely dry. I don't know why this happened, and it's never happened with any other ring, but I didn't feel comfortable with it and therefore decided this ring wasn't right for me. :( It's a shame because I really liked it! So if you're buying this ring to wear occasionally, I can only recommend it!! You won't be disappointed!
(PERSON3) Oh yes, I'm not sure if you caught <unintelligible> when we were talking about [PERSON1], but one thing is that the (output) is better, and the other thing is that the lemmata are correctly inflected manually. That's not a problem, though; it's actually good that <unintelligible> is correct. So, I thought it could be possible. I'm not sure if we have any test data for this, but we could try experimenting with the models using some kind of style transfer. As you know, we can use a constraint and try using a synonymous constraint instead to see or compare the difference in outputs. I'm describing this vaguely because I don't have a precise idea of how to do it myself, but it could have been an interesting, different scenario. [PERSON1], do you know anything about style transfer data for English-Czech? Do we have anything like that?
I haven't really achieved anything. I'm glad that a few people came to me privately and said: "Look, because of all your work, I'm going to give you this amount of money".
At the other end of the spectrum, only 184 foreign residents called Marka their home, and just over 700 lived in the city center. Ullern, Vestre Aker and Nordstrand were the other districts with the fewest foreign residents. But these had more immigrants than Oslo's city center and Marka. Immigrants from EU and EEA countries, as well as from the United Kingdom, mostly lived in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Old Oslo and St. Hanshaugen. While many citizens from Asia, including Turkey, also lived in Old Oslo (5,837), the majority were registered in the districts of Alna, Stovner and Søndre Nordstrand.
On the day of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, in which the World Trade Center was destroyed and 3,000 people were killed, Trump boasted in a television interview that 40 Wall Street was now suddenly the tallest building in the city. His claim was not only insensitive, it was also a lie.
The disgraced former MP Jared O'Mara "should never have been selected as a Labour candidate" and deserves his four-year prison sentence, the shadow chancellor said. Rachel Reeves spoke to the Guardian in the Bolton North East constituency on Friday, just hours after key figures in the local party had resigned in protest at the way the Labour-run National Executive Committee (NEC) had controlled the parliamentary selection process for the next general election.
This is a very brief presentation of a plausible argument that theories of capitalism, which influence the actual content of science, align with theories that assert the existence of objective scientific facts. This is *not* an argument for the existence of objective scientific facts, which I do not believe in.

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources came to the rescue of a very unfortunate bear after it got trapped in a ditch. The bear had retreated into a drainage culvert along the road near Wannaska, Minnesota, according to a Facebook post by the Department. But as the snow began to melt, the water level in the culvert rose and the bear became trapped in deep snow and ice, the Department said. Department staff responded quickly and helped the bear escape. The Department's bear biologist, Andrew Tri, "examined the bear and declared it healthy but groggy - apparently from being awakened from its winter sleep," according to the Facebook post. The Department then transported the bear to a state wildlife management area so it could continue its hibernation. The tired predator was estimated to be 6 years old and weigh between 375 and 400 pounds.

Modrow, a reform-oriented communist, took over the GDR leadership shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall and later invited opposition parties into the government, but could not slow down the increasing momentum of German reunification. "The entire peaceful process of German unification was particularly his merit," The Left wrote on Twitter. "This will remain his political legacy." During his 16 years as Communist Party leader in Dresden from 1973, Modrow established himself as an anti-establishment figure. He rejected party privileges and insisted on living in a normal apartment.

(PERSON8) I don't remember, well I don't remember exactly, but it was like - when I started these multi-source experiments in the summer. The first thing I did was linking paraphrase and source, and maybe I, I don't remember now, I can check before the next meeting if I also tried it, I definitely tried it, with the sources in the first position, then a delimiter and the paraphrase in the second position. It's possible that I also tried to mix the two things randomly, yes, and I only remember that there was a lot of cross-contamination and it experimented with multi-encoders.

A pedestrian has died after a collision with a car in Fife. The 38-year-old woman was taken by ambulance to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy after the accident on Broad Street in Cowdenbeath around 1:30 PM on Friday. A 24-year-old man was subsequently arrested in connection with the accident. The police are asking witnesses or drivers with dashcams who may have recorded the accident to come forward. Sergeant Lee Walkingshaw said: "Our investigations are ongoing and we ask all persons who were near the accident site and saw the accident, and drivers with dashcam footage that could assist with the investigation, to contact us. Anyone who can help, please call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 1638 and the accident date, Friday, February 10, 2023."
Excuse me, what? A friend had recommended the mask of this brand to me, so I bought it, the conditioner and the all-in-one milk. I can't say if the product works because the smell was simply unbearable. Do you know that musty smell that old buildings use in ladies' toilets to cover up the smell of *ladies*, but which then just becomes a sour, chemical, musty grandma smell? That's the only thing I can think of when I smell this. But there's no accounting for taste, maybe you like the smell. My friend said it helps even the most damaged hair, so if the smell doesn't bother you, don't worry. I know that natural products don't smell as good as synthetic ones, but I feel like more and more natural brands don't care nowadays because it sells anyway, and now everything smells like modeling clay. I've had to give up many of my favorite brands because the formula was changed to cheaper ingredients. I don't know if that's the case here or if it's a fake (I called Davines and they said no), but it smells DISGUSTING and I had to return it.
The news that Special Counsel Jack Smith has subpoenaed Mike Pence raises the following question: How will the Trump team use the court to thwart this latest development in the Justice Department's investigation? The short answer is that any attempt to thwart Pence's subpoena by invoking executive privilege is likely to fail. First of all, there's the question of whether a former president can even claim the privilege. Remember that Trump unsuccessfully tried to prevent the January 6 special committee from obtaining White House documents.

The tombs of Djehuti and Hery were inaugurated on Thursday after the completion of restoration work. The inauguration was carried out by the Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities of Egypt, Mostafa Waziri, the Ambassador of Spain to Egypt, Alvaro Iranzo, and the President of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Eloísa del Pino. Waziri explained that the two tombs were discovered during a joint Egyptian-Spanish archaeological mission of the Supreme Council of Antiquities and CSIC, who have been collaborating since 2002. He said that the mission carried out excavation and restoration work and published research regarding the tombs, which are located in the Dra Abu al-Naga region on the west bank of the Nile in Luxor. They managed to uncover many tombs, sarcophagi, mummies and a burial garden.
Humanity comes out in 5 days. It's exciting, nerve-wracking, stressful, and encompasses all the good things I love about working on games. What will people think about it? I like it, but will it be able to attract an audience with the right players? Will a community form around the user-created content of the game? (I hope so, at least.) The game's story, ideas, and questions it poses seem timely. I hope everything goes well.

How would you share personal libraries?
It was difficult to follow the book as it jumped back and forth a lot. The title doesn't fit the story either. The author says that several people were infected by this alien, but left out details about when and how it happened. I was sometimes confused and had to go back and reread many passages to make sure I hadn't missed anything.
(PERSON6) For the upcoming meetings, and I inquired about the request because I saw the (meme) project demo. They do offline subtitling. So, it's a bit simpler than what we do. They still have the same problems with segmentation and so on. But their task in translation is shortening, simply because the data always gets shorter. And that's because their target size is the subtitles created for the hearing impaired. So there's a kind of natural shortening in the data. It would be great if we could also find such a type of data where natural shortening occurs. We would integrate it into the architecture.

After having read almost nothing for decades (with the exception of functional, work-related non-fiction books and the occasional self-help book), I set myself the goal of reading 23 books in 2023.
(PERSON8) I tried it, I believe with two tokens and yes, because in the first version we suspected that the token itself could also be tokenized, so I repeated it with another token that's not solely intended for this purpose, as we were using a trained dictionary, and this dictionary didn't contain any separation tokens. So I used a token that I assumed wouldn't be tokenized into multiple parts and would thus only appear once. I wasn't certain that this token wouldn't appear elsewhere in the sentence, and this is the only place where it could appear. Yes, I agree it could be done better.

Confusing plot
The controller has a slimmer design that fits better in the hand and has no sharp corners to snag on. With the permanently attached cable, it also doesn't get damaged nearly as quickly as the original XB1 controller. The disadvantages are: 1) The vibration effect triggered in action games feels significantly weaker. 2) The directional joystick and buttons of the controller wear out quickly. We play quite forcefully and need 2–3 controllers a year. So if we invest in controllers annually, we need to be selective and pay close attention to which ones we buy. The controller could have more solid springs, because after just a few months, the most used buttons no longer respond and the right joystick doesn't stay in the center, suddenly zooming in on overview maps or making characters walk forward without touching the controls.
Very good looking guitar. Too bad the company doesn't know how to protect their product. Don't try to get one that isn't damaged.

As she went on to explain, behind this lies a strategy that most people within the Beltway would consider crazy: This is the best method to gain the trust of the press. The press knows that we don't deceive like everyone else. SIGTARP will quickly become the only credible source of information in Washington about TARP. Occasionally it might be embarrassing for us and we say something we could easily sweep under the rug - and others would do so - but we shock the press with our honesty. No one else does this, and sooner or later we've built our own defense when we're attacked. Regardless of what the press hears, they will always come to us first and believe us because we prove to them that we're telling the truth. This might be the most important reason for Biden to take the path of radical accountability: There will always be moments in every presidency when it's important to have the trust of the public and the institutions that protect citizens' interests. Moreover, important capital can be gained by owning up to our mistakes, and here Biden can make an important difference compared to his political opponents. The President would do well to follow the old saying: Tell the truth - and shame the devil.
Forget me, okay. Ignore me, okay. It hurts, but you have to do it.
(PERSON1) Yes, because I think it's a method that is very easy to test, and it should always be tested in comparison with the two encoders. I would expect it to sometimes perform better and sometimes worse than the one with the two encoders, depending on the specific task and what exactly the second thing is that you're encoding. So if you have two copies or two paraphrases of the same sentence, it might be somewhat confusing for the attention mechanism. The behavior could also differ between the old sequence-to-sequence methods and the transformer. With RNNs, it behaves differently, and with the transformer, it might be more difficult to train, so you may need to increase the number of warm-up steps or warm-up sentences.

I can only say good things about this set of gift bags. I was able to wrap all my Christmas presents with the bags, wrapping paper, and tissue paper. The product is of very high quality and the various size options make it easy to choose the perfect one for each gift. I really highly recommend it. The seller is very nice and attentive. He contacted me after my purchase to ensure I was satisfied with the product. Clear 5 stars!
No, I haven't edited it. Well, [PERSON1] said that as soon as she gets the transcript, we'll do it together.
I find akkoma, the software and the domain name I got for my instance, pretty good. But I feel like I started this instance off on the wrong foot, so to speak. And I never felt comfortable with it. I'll stay here a bit longer and think about whether I should migrate at all.
In any case, since it applies here, to fix it, I had to extend my viewport implementation to include the IDirect3DViewport3 methods, so that the call to the new one was valid.
Intersexuality is even recognized by TERFs and the like, since it is generally more physical and thus visible. Just as mental health is seen by many as less "real" than physical health, I somehow have the feeling that being transsexual is just an intersexuality of the mind.
Biden's Justice Department "doesn't want armed citizens"
Yes, so for the English with multiple accents. Well, [PERSON14], we are now in the process of combining this into a single technical solution. The current idea that [PERSON14] is working on is creating new sentences using words spoken in other sentences, and he will do this with different speakers. So these will truly be sentences spoken by multiple speakers, potentially improving stability regarding the different accents of these speakers. This is a partial experiment. Later, we might do more regarding the issue of different accents. These new sentences will attempt to solve two problems with one experiment. One problem is the implicit language model. The Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system needs to see the maximum possible set of sentences. We will create new sentences from the text-only language model by adding the audio component, improving both the language model for ASR and stability across different speakers. Yesterday, I heard another idea during a presentation at the training. They cut out time and frequency bands from the audio. They were trained with impaired inputs, which also extremely improved the system's stability.
(In case you're wondering, I've tried pretty much every "humane" trap on the market with very little success. I'm not particularly happy about killing them, but I won't engage in any comments on the ethics of killing mice.)
And I believe only two or three sentences were correctly inflected in the wrong context, as if the translation was incorrect. And then there are some cases where the translation was completely wrong because the sentence was really incorrect, and that part must have been <unintelligible>, but that was only the case once or twice.
(PERSON11) This is important. Please write this here in the documentation, this <unintelligible/> summary, because it's for [PERSON2]. And also [PERSON2], when you speak with [PERSON10], well, yeah, and maybe also [PERSON5]. If we have this tool, we'll need to send the audio to multiple ASRs or multiple workers <unintelligible/>. We'll need to send the audio separately to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR and the Czech ASR, for example, depending on the <other_noise/> and also to this language ID worker, and then we'll need to merge these outputs, and this is a tool we don't have yet. This is the multi-source tool that monitors the text outputs and also follows the timestamps, and it would emit – it would probably produce the output in three separate language channels, to use either silence or the correct ASR. So we need a filter for the ASRs, so that the ASR is silent when it's the wrong language, and it's the recognized text when it's the correct language. I just thought of this kind of configuration. Another configuration would be that the same sound is sent to the ASR and this language checker. This language checker is basically a part of the ASR that mutes the ASR when it's the wrong language. That's also an option. So we need to figure out which way of integrating the language ID is best for our purposes. So please continue to think about what our pipelines are. Ideally, I think there would be the least confusion in management and so on if our MT models were multilingual. If they supported different source languages and would translate from any of these languages into English. They would possibly just create a copy if the input was in English, so we would have multilingual multi-ASRs at the beginning. Everything goes into English, and then from English into all languages. And later, when [PERSON12] has a multilingual model of ASR, this language ID would no longer be needed.
Well, one of them was for me yesterday.

The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching as you park the flyer on the red ground, but they don't move towards you, they're even motionless as you climb out of the flyer and slowly approach them. The ground beneath your feet begins to tremble and then shakes as if in an earthquake, and you lose your footing, but this doesn't seem to bother the Repnids. Suddenly, the rock beneath you gives way. The Repnids have dug a tunnel under the surface and you fall into a seething mass of hundreds of Repnid bodies in a cave below. It ends quickly, as several pairs of fangs inject their deadly venom and the air of Dyskra contaminates your lungs. No one will ever know that you were the first human visitor from the future.
The more I read about studies on sex, gender, and psychology, the more the statement "I am biologically male, my gender is female" seems simplified and inaccurate. It almost seems like handing part of the argument over to TERFs. I think being transgender means being "biologically non-binary." I am non-binary, my gender is female.
"Antonio Conte complained about the defense, and this player is currently struggling to defend well. Barnes and Maddison are very good opponents, but Porro's performance is very disappointing." Although the goal was not recognized due to offside, Barnes restored the 4-1 lead nine minutes before the end of the second half. Although Tottenham beat Manchester City last week, Tottenham missed the opportunity to move ahead of Newcastle into third place.
I've been toying with this idea for a while:

I asked the seller before buying if the color wasn't too yellow, and I was told it was like old gold, darker. It's not even close to that! The item looks VERY cheap. It's an extremely bright yellow with lots of KSZ, even more glittery. Looks great in the photo, but I wouldn't even give the real thing to a teenager.

The battery life of the one I bought on Amazon is terrible. I still can't believe that Logitech no longer offers this remote control, no other is even remotely comparable. I LOVE this Harmony remote, this is my fourth one. My dog chewed up the first one, my husband knelt on the screen of the second one, and the third one still works but has an elbow print in the middle of the touchscreen, also from my husband... I bought this as a replacement and the screen is flawless, but the included battery only lasts a few days. My other one (the third) lasts for weeks and I use my remote for everything.

Africans formed the third largest immigrant group in Oslo, with 28,020 people from Africa living in Oslo. Europeans from countries that are not part of the United Kingdom, the EU or the EEA were the fourth largest group, with 15,566 residents in Oslo. From here, the size of the groups decreases significantly. For example, in 2022 there were only just under 7,000 citizens from South American countries and barely over 3,000 nationals from North and Central America. Fewer than 700 people from Oceania lived in Oslo.
I bought the capsules in February. Recently I tried to use them, but unfortunately one of my Keurig machines gives me an error message every time that the capsule is not compatible with the machine. I have used Donut Shop capsules in my machine since purchasing and never had a problem. After looking more closely at the coffee capsules, I noticed that the code on top of the capsule is not very legible, so I assume I received a faulty box. I bought a box with 72 capsules, so 6 packs of 12 capsules each. I even tried a capsule from all 6 packs, but always get the same error message. I know it's not my machine because other capsules I've tried work fine. I only have problems with this delivery. Very disappointing, as my return period has already expired. UPDATE: I spoke with a customer service representative who refunded my money. Thank you AMAZON for the wonderful customer service!

Adriana Kuch, 14, was found dead in her home in Bayville on February 3, two days after the disturbing video of the attack at Central Regional High School was posted online.

They pushed Adriana into the red lockers lining the school corridors, and one of the girls in a pink shirt repeatedly hit Kuch.
I'm giving 3 stars for now. I don't want to leave the seller a bad review if they don't deserve it, but this drone overheats very often. I don't know if I should contact the seller or DJI Tello directly, but I'll probably try both to see what they say. I like the drone, it's a cool little toy that flies better than some larger, older drones and some of my larger drones feel more like toys than this one. However, it's also the only drone I've ever had problems with overheating, and that spoils the fun of flying. I assume it's a manufacturing defect that needs to be fixed as soon as possible if the product is to be successful. I really hope the seller didn't send me a used drone because I paid for a new one. I can praise the seller for the delivery, as it arrived 1 day after purchase. I will update my review after contacting the seller and DJI Tello.

In his later life, Modrow served on the Council of Elders of Die Linke. "Hans was a deeply sincere and combative socialist," tweeted Dietmar Bartsch, the parliamentary group leader of Die Linke. "Into his old age, he was an important advisor in our party, whose wisdom will be missed."
Yes, I think - didn't Dominik perform some experiments with Ivana? I believe it was last year or two years ago for Double Empty, where they investigated the context and its connection to the input sentence and conducted a form of document-level translation. However, the issue is that with this connection, it's not entirely certain whether it has the same effect, since we use a multi-encoder setup.
Great importance is placed on the development of sports infrastructure. "A clear proof of this is this sports facility with space for over six thousand people," according to the letter from the Kazakh president. Kazakh athletes successfully participate in major global sporting events, where they represent Kazakhstan. They are an example for a growing generation and inspire youth to great achievements, Tokayev noted. He expressed confidence that hosting the Asian Championships in Astana will give new impetus to the development of athletics in the country and called for better cooperation with international organizations in this area.

And my idea is that a customer clicks on this microphone button and starts speaking, and when the customer speaks, the audio is simultaneously sent in small pieces. Let's say 200 or even 100 milliseconds. And to the HTTP server, which queues it up for later processing with (ASR). And the model will do some logic, some inference with it. And whenever it has a new piece of transcript, it will send it back, and the customer should receive the partial transcript. And it should be displayed immediately in the text field.
Yes, yes, it's very important to parallelize everything - both the processing of the systems and the evaluation of the cell DF - because he would have to do it many times. There will be errors, so you need to repeat it quickly.
Yes, thank you.

Spiny anteaters with amethyst and magenta-colored quills. They are medium-sized, have an average build, and are muscular. Their tail is very thick. Their hair is raspberry-colored, short, and curly. Their eyes are pear-shaped, and they wear scarlet cat-eye glasses. Their most interesting feature is their tendency to perform good deeds.
I'm currently playing around a bit with Flutter. To be honest, I would hate to build my business on Google technology, but on the other hand, Google is one of the few big players with real incentives to create an appealing cross-platform experience, and you can see that.
Abe conceals his worries and laughs easily, while Tom isn't afraid to cry but is less amused by crude humor. Jan will hurt you before letting you see that she's hurt, and laughs the most when everything is in chaos. Mio knows that suffering is a constant companion in life.
I was very disappointed when I received the item because the silver part surrounding the watch face appears to be made of a very cheap type of plastic. What disappoints me is not the fact that it's plastic, but that the plastic used makes the watch look incredibly cheap. This detail ruined the entire appearance for me. I also didn't trust that it would withstand daily wear, so I sent it back. I was disappointed because it would have been a good deal if not for that issue. If this isn't a problem for you, it could be a good deal. It was well packaged and arrived quickly.
I'm fed up with conservative parties and governments that present themselves as business-friendly. They are not, at least not in Alberta.
Tim Sherwood criticizes £44 million acquisition of Pedro Porro after catastrophic debut at Tottenham
You land the aircraft nose-up on the side of the spoil heap and climb out. The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching, but they don't move towards you, and are even motionless as you slowly approach them. You pause for a moment on the hill of crumbling rock and earth, speak to them and say: "I come in peace, as a friend". It seems that they can't hear you, let alone understand you, as your universal translator receives no response. You decide to use your extrasensory consciousness to make mental contact with them. It's difficult to understand their thoughts; they are frighteningly alien, and your mind recoils from making contact. You decide that attempting contact again would be dangerous, and return to your aircraft, but the experience has cleared your mind, which had been foggy since you jumped into the future. Back in the Falcon's Wing, it's fairly easy for you to set a course for Earth in the year 3034 AD. Keep in mind that you've used another polybdenum rod during the jump.
I mean, for text flow we use something like Hypercore, but I'm not sure if that would work for this.
This evening, a young artist didn't take some criticism well. Partly because he was poorly trained. But it's important not to make up excuses and simply solve the problems, especially in production when your lead role needs to change. Above all when facing competition.
I bought this lamp to enhance the light my new vegetable seedlings receive from the window. I love many features of these lamps. Advantages: First of all, they easily attach to my shelf and can be bent into many positions, allowing me to make adjustments as my plants grow larger. The lights feel cool to the touch and haven't caused damage when they've touched the plants. I believe the light has helped my vegetables. The lights are dimmable, but I only use the brightest setting. I haven't used the timer yet; I prefer to turn them on and off myself. However, this can be useful in an office with houseplants or when on vacation. Disadvantages: I don't think these lights are strong enough to serve as the main light source for cultivated plants. The lights are small! If the bulbs burn out, I have to buy a completely new lamp.
I would like to see how these companies that facilitate transactions explain to their customers how they set their percentages. They won't talk about it on Bloomberg! But if Spotify has a good quarter, they will.

The Kazakh Prime Minister Smailov expressed special gratitude to the President of the Asian Athletics Association Dahlan al-Hamad for his help in preparing and conducting the championships. The Asian Indoor Athletics Championships were held for the first time in the CIS. The tournament brought together over 500 athletes from 31 countries, competing in running, relay, long jump, high jump, triple jump, pole vault, shot put, and decathlon. The tournament runs until February 12. Previously, it was reported that at the tournament, Kazakh runner Caroline Chepkoech Kipkirui won gold in the women's 3,000-meter run and Olga Safronova won silver in the women's 60-meter run.

Remote work makes many things possible. It allows people to work in comfortable spaces instead of stuffy, noisy offices. It is accessible to anyone who has an internet connection and a suitable place to work. It enables people to avoid long commutes to work, which cost them time from their day and with their families.
That's something I've also never said before.

I had the good fortune to spend six unforgettable months alongside Nicholas in 2011 and support a number of projects. When we met at the weekend, I was delighted to learn about the progress, especially in planting trees and supporting agriculture. Thousands of trees were planted and farmers were able to increase their harvests through a series of measures - from assistance in purchasing equipment to training.
This is a very beautiful skirt. The lace pattern is stylish and soft. It doesn't wrinkle; even after being stuffed in plastic and a box, it was still very smooth, which is really cool. The skirt can easily be worn with dressy or casual clothing and has a certain vintage feel due to its length and cut, which I really like. I think it will suit everyone. I'm 5 feet 5 inches (165 cm) tall and weigh 130 pounds (59 kg) and ordered it in S, and I would say that if you can't decide between S and M, you should definitely choose the smaller size.

A 16-year-old was charged with murder for shooting two students at a high school in Chicago in December, police announced on Friday. The suspect is charged with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder, Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown announced. "We currently have no clear motive why a 16-year-old would shoot other children," Brown said. The suspect's name was not released on Friday due to his age, even though Brown said he will be charged as an adult with murder and attempted murder.
Figures from the Norwegian statistical office showed that foreigners are distributed across all districts of the city, with over 14,000 immigrants registered in Søndre Nordstrand, the southernmost district of Oslo. Many immigrants also lived in desirable neighborhoods; Frogner ranked fifth among the districts with the most foreigners. Stovner, Bjerke, Grorud, Østensjø and Sagene were the remaining five of the ten Oslo districts with the most residents from another country.

The owner of the Russian private military company Wagner Group, which is actively involved in the fighting in Ukraine, predicts that the war could continue for years. Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video interview released on Friday evening that Russia could take 18 months to two years to gain full control of the Donbas, Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland. He added that the war could go on for three years if Moscow decides to capture more territories east of the Dnieper River.
(PERSON6) And I think we could probably just get the data from them because they have such a large set of videos, mainly with different domains and different native languages of the speakers on [ORGANISATION5]. And I had the idea that we could simply use a tool to download certain filtered videos from [ORGANISATION5] and create a training set from them.

Photos: After restorations, Egypt inaugurates the Djehuti and Hery tombs
GAZIANTEP.KAZINFORM - Kazakh rescuers continue to dig through the rubble in Turkey in search of survivors, according to Kazinform, as reported by the press service of the Kazakh Ministry of Emergency Situations. The rescuers' work is hindered by large amounts of debris and unstable structures. So far, the Kazakh rescue team in Turkey has recovered seven earthquake survivors and the bodies of 19 people, including a child. First aid is also provided around the clock. A considerable earthquake of magnitude 7.7, which devastated southeastern parts of Turkey and northern Syria, occurred on Monday morning. To date, the death toll from the powerful earthquake that struck southeastern Turkey already exceeds 20,000.
In our daily lives, we constantly search for methods to increase our energy and avoid burnout, especially in our jobs. This can be extremely difficult for people in healthcare, so I asked 30 health and wellness professionals the same question: "How do you manage to allocate your energy and not burn out in your profession?" Their occupations ranged from infectious disease specialists to psychologists and mindfulness instructors - and they all gave great advice on how to stay motivated and keep going. Despite the significant differences in their activities, there were some themes in their answers that stood out as methods to avoid burnout.
Russia suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in the autumn as the Ukrainian military launched successful counteroffensives to recapture broad swaths of territory in the east and south. The Kremlin has avoided making predictions about how long the fighting might continue. Instead, it says that what it calls the "special military operation" will continue until its goals are met. Russian forces have focused on the Ukrainian provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk, which make up the Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014.
I bleached all my hair a few months ago and then dyed it black. Then I had highlights done all over. A few weeks later, I put blue and green Arctic Fox hair dye in my hair, which just won't fade. I applied this with Olaplex No. 3 and it made everything SIGNIFICANTLY lighter, so that the green and blue areas disappeared and the black color also became lighter. A day later, however, I noticed a green tint in my hair. It's getting worse every day and I've already used the hair color remover twice - with the same results. My hair is also getting darker where I applied the hair color remover. This is a great product, but its effects just don't seem to last long.
In the midst of a protest in front of Tate Britain, a person was arrested. A children's event featuring a drag queen telling stories was being held there. According to the Metropolitan Police, one person was arrested on suspicion of making a racist comment towards a police officer in front of the art gallery near Westminster. No injuries were reported and officers remain on site, according to the police.

Then I agree that there's a lot of unimportant content in this dictionary. So I asked if you could have different versions of this dictionary by only taking the words that were counted five times. And only the pronunciations that were detected three times or more, or something like that. This way, random errors like the example with four IBMs instead of IBM won't happen as often. But you'll still have pronunciation variants, because if the person says "alzo" with a "Z" 20 times in the conversation, you'll see that in the data. And if they sometimes manage to say it correctly, you'll see that in the data too. So, I want [PERSON4] to be in contact with [PERSON2]. Maybe you continue talking on the phone, right? I have to go now because I need to give the kids lunch and so on. But please stay on this call and figure out together how to use the dictionary. [PERSON4], please show [PERSON2] which dictionary the system accepts. Share your screen and show it. And [PERSON2], please take a look at it and help with converting the dictionary you've output into this file. One thing still needed is the replacement of the language model. But all these words should be known words. So [PERSON4], you need to figure out which words occur in the language model. And the words that occur in the language model should simply be copied. The dictionary will have three columns: the grapheme as it's output, the phonemes as suggested by [PERSON2] with multiple rows for different phoneme variants, and the third column will be the same for all, again the grapheme form. That's what the language model sees. I think these systems should be able to load it this way. You'll probably encounter another problem: it's not yet designed for two large custom dictionaries. That's also something that needs testing, but please test it, both of you together. This way [PERSON2] knows what he created in the dictionary, and you know what the dictionary looks like when you create it manually. You need to combine these two pieces of knowledge so that it works with the generated dictionary.

3 1/2 stars Remedy is a romance novel about both the brother's best friend and a second chance. It's a unique story and the main character (Grady) has to do everything to win Collins back and prove that he's the man for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had a great night together. Collins thought she was finally getting everything she'd always dreamed of: her brother's best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning and never heard from him, everything changed drastically. Now Grady is back and won't leave again, and he's doing everything in his power to prove why he left and that he won't give up this time. I really liked the idea of this story and sometimes Grady too, but he really got on my nerves. I completely understand why he had to leave after that night, but couldn't he at least send Collins a letter explaining the reason? Instead, he leaves her confused and hurt for years and then expects her to welcome him with open arms? Is he crazy?! Collins is rightfully angry, furious, hurt, etc. She rightfully argued with him when he wanted her back and moved on with her life. I admire her willpower in the face of Grady's persistence. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong and she protected her heart, and I admire her for that. Sure, she still loves Grady, but she was afraid and hesitant to let him back into her life. Who wouldn't be after what he did to her? Of the two, I definitely prefer her character. She let things move as fast as she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she did. There's a lot of fear in this book and I enjoyed watching the two of them get closer again after Collins started to forgive Grady. I just wish Grady didn't come across as so whiny and that he had more understanding. He always said he understood, but sometimes he was a bit too pushy for me, and then very gentle at the end. By the end, I liked him just as much as Collins, but at the beginning of the book, I had trouble reading his perspective because I couldn't connect with his character. So I didn't particularly like the first part of the book, but the second part? I loved it, hence my rating. If you like love stories about second chances and the brother's best friend, you might really enjoy this book. I just had problems with Grady at first and how he dealt with some of the things he had done.
But did I love it? Absolutely!
Derry City emerged victorious from the President's Cup after winning 2-0 against Shamrock Rovers. The FAI Cup holders defeated last season's winners at Brandywell due to first-half goals from Will Patching and Michael Duffy. The Hoops eased off in the second half, but Ruaidhri Higgins' shots were strong enough to win the season opener. Derry will travel to St Patrick's Athletic for their first league game of the season next Friday. Patching's side-footed volley put Derry ahead after 23 minutes - the midfielder scoring the opener just as he did when the Foylesiders played 2-1 against the eventual champions last February.
There was particular dissatisfaction that Leigh Drennan, the chair of Labour North West and advisor to Warrington North MP Charlotte Nichols, who supports Jeremy Corbyn, was not placed on the longlist to try to win back seats from the Conservatives, despite being nominated by four major unions. Reeves said she had nothing to do with the selection of candidates, but added: "I know it's very important that we have rigorous processes for who can be put on the longlist and who can be put on the shortlist."
In recent years, certain Hindu hardliners have raided shops selling Valentine's Day items, burned cards and gifts, and chased away hand-holding couples from restaurants and parks, insisting that the day violates traditional values and promotes sexual permissiveness. Hindu nationalist groups such as Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal have stated that such raids help reinforce Hindu identity. Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi say that his government is pursuing a Hindu agenda and seeks to establish the dominance of the religion in a secular nation known for its diversity. Nearly 80% of the nearly 1.4 billion people are Hindus, while Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains make up most of the rest.
The hatred for literature classes is even greater: I love reading. I had read most of the classics before my eighteenth birthday – although that's more a reflection of life in the back of beyond, in my desperation I even read the Encyclopedia Britannica from 1979.

Bluetooth is better than Wi-Fi connection! I bought this product for my wife in October 2017. At that time, we were in the middle of moving and living in a hotel. I couldn't manage to connect the scale to the hotel's Wi-Fi. So I decided to wait until we moved into our own house and I could set up my own Wi-Fi. In March 2018, I set up my Wi-Fi and the scale still won't connect. I get an error message every time I try. Even when I'm only 10 feet away from the Wi-Fi unit. I've also unsuccessfully followed the setup videos on YouTube. When I bought the device, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wi-Fi router to communicate with the phone. The system is limited to the router connection... which is usually not close to the bedroom, unlike a phone! Due to the Wi-Fi connection, I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone. Instead, look for systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I will also replace it with a scale that has a Bluetooth connection.

Waziri explained that these tombs belong to significant individuals who lived during the beginning of the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom - one of the most important eras of Ancient Egypt. He said that the layout of the tombs is T-shaped, a style commonly used in tombs of the 18th Dynasty. These consist of an entrance area, a pillared hall leading to a burial shaft, and walls displaying distinct inscriptions. Waziri added that Djehuti was the overseer of the state treasury and supervised the work of craftsmen and artists during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut.

"The circumstances regarding O'Hara were 'quite extraordinary,'" said Reeves, but she admitted: "The Labour Party and all political parties have important things to learn about candidate selection. But I would also say that in this Parliament we have seen the constant undermining of political standards, not least through a succession of prime ministers and fines and parties and standards falling far short of expectations." She added: "One thing I can say about the Labour Party is that if someone does something wrong, he or she can't be the parliamentary group leader anymore. And that's simply not the case with the Conservative Party."
(PERSON6) So this is an important issue that we should have stumbled upon months ago. Remember, I've been telling you since August that we want to evaluate with a later test set. And every time, all of you... it's not just about you personally, [PERSON8]. There were other things, obviously. But every time you thought about it, you thought: "This will be easy, we'll just execute it". And only when you actually do it, you see all the problems. So, this is known, quite normal. It's always like that. So this is a message for everyone. Before you try, you never know what the problem will be. For example, the call I had when someone interviewed me, so they wanted to record the video. Zoom has never worked as poorly for me as it did today during the recording. So, before you do it, you can't say whether it will work or not. And here we encounter problems with converting file formats. Hopefully we'll get the numbers quickly then. So, do you have any word error rates so far?
I've learned the hard way that local TV station websites offer the absolute worst experience on the internet in 2023. Pop-ups, auto-playing videos, animations, pop-overs, and ads, ads, ads. I know they make their money from ads, but all this junk seems counterproductive if it drives people away. This is still true even now that goatse.cx is gone, though it would be a close race to the bottom between goatse and, say, khou.com, where I tried to watch a video Wendy sent me.
I think it's really an interesting question whether we can use the constraints to force this kind of speaker gender in the translation.
Jami gave him the note as they passed each other on the path just before the dog watch. She was on her way to the wall, he had just finished his shift. He looked behind him to watch her go and to make sure they weren't seen. She didn't turn around. He waited until he reached the darkness of the bunk before pulling out the note and reading it in a beam of light that shone through the blackout curtains. One word printed in block letters. He stared at it for a long time, trying to stay calm:
One of the fans wasn't running smoothly right after unpacking. The speed control mechanism is unusual: when you set it to 100%, the fans turn off, so you have to set it to 100% and then reduce it slightly until they start again. The build quality is mediocre, but that seems to be normal for products in this price range. The stands that hold the laptop have come off a few times... They can be reinserted, but it happens so often that it's annoying. On a positive note, I can say that the fan position is ideal for laptops that draw air through vents on top of the laptop. Many other fans have fans in the middle and offer little extra airflow for laptops with such cooling.
Yes, when the context is too short, and because I make decisions based on a very short context for this very low latency time, it really commits to something that, for example, finds out in a second or two, "Oh well, that was really a bad translation." So it tries to use a different phrasing, for instance, to specify the matter. Actually, I really liked this approach. I like some of the translations. I was really surprised; although you could see that the model made mistakes on the first attempt, it really wanted to perform some kind of correction. And it sounded very fluent, which I think is also important. If you really require a low latency, then I think even a slightly lower quality is okay if it's fluent. Because if the translation quality is poor and not fluent, then I think the translation is simply pointless. However, if the quality is lower because, when you read everything, you get the same information, but the wording is just awkward due to using more words, corrections, and such things, then I think this is completely fine for simultaneous translation as long as you don't lose information. And for which language pairs do you have these results, some examples? I'd like to take a look at that, just out of curiosity.

It's crazy to do weightlifting but also have no real idea what your one-repetition maximum is, because that's one of the main ways people track their progress. I train alone in my bedroom, without a spotter or even a weight rack. There's just me and a barbell with a bunch of weights. I do bench presses on my bed. If I try to find out my one-repetition maximum, I probably don't have enough weights to reach my maximum, or on the other hand, I could seriously injure or kill myself. Anyway, today I'm adding a few more weights. Still feels good.

The incident occurred as a result of an increase in the number of refugees and asylum seekers crossing the English Channel to Great Britain in boats. Police have arrested 15 people after anti-refugee demonstrations outside a hotel near the English city of Liverpool, used to accommodate asylum seekers, turned violent. According to the Merseyside Police Station, a police officer and two civilians suffered minor injuries during the tumultuous events in Knowsley on Friday evening. Police reported that some demonstrators threw objects and set fire to a police car. The arrested individuals, aged between 13 and 54, were detained "due to violent disturbances." Merseyside Police Commissioner Emily Spurrell told Radio City, "It was incredibly dangerous and there were some injuries among police officers."
