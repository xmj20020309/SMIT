I swear, Burrata was not around five years ago.
I don't know exactly why my brain can't figure that out; maybe the tools are just so extensive and vague that my brain simply switches off due to "too many options."
Because for Interspeech, we could also divide it paper by paper. So that some papers would go into the Interspeech proceedings. And some of our submitted papers would later appear in the PBML proceedings. And the authors could choose freely. So we have to negotiate this either with SIGDial or with Interspeech. Whether it is okay for them to receive some of our papers, as these papers will be submitted by the March deadline. So there is a very strict requirement. And I think they won't have any objections. Because if the paper is worth publishing. It is just a bonus that the paper is a result of a joint task appearing in the satellite event. So yes, I think it's okay. We don't need to request a special session. At Interspeech, it is called a special session, we don't want that. At Interspeech, we want the satellite event. But we will tell our people. If you have your paper ready by the Interspeech deadline, submit it as an Interspeech paper and you will have it within Interspeech. Ah, if you don't make it by the Interspeech deadline, here is our deadline. And that is for PBML.
My neighbor and I arrived home at the same time, and I could hear him coughing up a corona phlegm storm from across the street. So I hurried to get into my apartment to avoid meeting him, but he still managed to catch up with me to talk. I swear that corona-infected zombies are trying to infect everyone else.
(PERSON1) Yes, so, I mean, I just did the same thing now.
That would mainly be for surfing the internet, occasionally for emails, and some games.
(PERSON10) Okay, so a question just for me, to make sure that you insert the token for sentence separation in the linking settings, right? Do you have a special token to distinguish which is the source and which is the context or the other sentence, or do you just link them without anything? And hope that the system learns it?
Donald Trump's heavily mortgaged skyscraper on Wall Street 40 is under "lender scrutiny" against the backdrop of falling income and rising costs, Bloomberg reported on Friday. The vacancy rate of the 72-story building - Trump's most valuable - jumped to nearly 18% in the third quarter of last year, according to a monthly filing on the remaining $126.5 million mortgage, Bloomberg reported. Meanwhile, expenses have reportedly increased by 11% since the mortgage began in 2015. Trump has often boasted about the building, which he acquired in 1995 and was valued at $540 million in 2015.
I really liked this ring - but I couldn't wear it all the time! :( This ring was very beautiful. I liked the design and how heavy it felt; it looked expensive and was very comfortable to wear! The only reason I am giving it 3 stars and ultimately returned it is because I noticed that I wouldn't be able to wear it all the time. I like to wear my rings continuously, which is why I always make sure to buy ones made of sterling silver. I know some people have said that their rings tarnished after a while, but I had worn mine continuously for a week - even when washing my hands - and could not see any tarnishing. The problem I had was, interestingly, that the inside of the ring made my finger white and moist - similar to when wearing a bandage for a long time. This happened even when I made sure both my ring and finger were completely dry. I don't know why this happened, and it has never happened with any other ring, but I didn't feel comfortable with it and therefore decided that this ring was not right for me. :( It's a shame because I really liked it! So if you are buying this ring to wear occasionally, I can only recommend it to you!! You will not be disappointed!
Oh yes, I just don't know if you caught <unintelligible/> when we talked about [PERSON1], but one thing is that the (stroke) is better, but the other thing is that the lemmata really need to be manually inflected correctly, but that's, that's another, no, not a problem, it's even good that <unintelligible/> is correct, yes. So, I thought it might be. But I'm not sure if we have some test data for that, but we could try playing around with the models, with some kind of style transfer? As you know, we can use a constraint and try using a synonymous constraint instead to see or compare how, how, what the difference between the outputs is. But that's, I'm just describing it vaguely because I myself have no exact idea of how to do it, but it could have been an interesting, different scenario. I don't know, [PERSON1], do you know anything about style transfer data for English-Czech? Do we have anything there?
I haven't really achieved anything. I'm glad that a few people have come to me privately and said, "Look, because of all your work, I will give you this sum of money."
At the other end of the spectrum, only 184 foreign residents called Marka their home, and just over 700 lived in the city center. Ullern, Vestre Aker, and Nordstrand were the other districts with the fewest foreign residents. But these had more immigrants than the Oslo city center and Marka. Immigrants from EU and EEA countries as well as from the United Kingdom mostly lived in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Old Oslo, and St. Hanshaugen. While many residents from Asia, including Turkey, also lived in Old Oslo (5,837), the majority were reported in the districts of Alna, Stovner, and Søndre Nordstrand.
On the day of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, in which the World Trade Center was destroyed and 3,000 people were killed, Trump boasted in a television interview that 40 Wall Street was now suddenly the tallest building in the city. His claim was not only insensitive, it was also a lie.
The former MP Jared O'Mara, who has fallen out of favor, "should never have been selected as a Labour candidate" and deserves his four-year prison sentence, said the Shadow Chancellor. Rachel Reeves spoke in the Bolton North East constituency with the Guardian on Friday, just hours after key figures in the local party had resigned to protest against the way the Labour-led National Executive Committee (NEC) had controlled the parliamentary selection process for the next general election.

According to TMZ, Kilcher cast the two in September. Kilcher made a breakthrough in 2002 with Terrence Malick's film "The New World", in which she played Pocahontas. Her filmography also features "Sons of Anarchy", "The Alienist", and "Dora and the Lost City of Gold". She recently starred in the road trip film "Dog" with Channing Tatum in the lead role.

Modrow, a reform-oriented communist, took over the leadership of the GDR shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall and later invited opposition parties into the government, but could not slow down the increasing momentum of German reunification. "The entire peaceful process of the establishment of German unity was just a special merit of his," wrote Die Linke on Twitter. "That will remain his political legacy." In the 16 years, from 1973 as the head of the Communist Party in Dresden, Modrow made a name for himself as an anti-establishment figure. He rejected party privileges and insisted on living in a normal apartment.

I don't remember, so I don't remember exactly, but that's like - when I started with these multi-source experiments in the summer. The first thing I did was linking paraphrase and source and maybe, I don't remember now, I can check until the next meeting if I also tried it, I definitely tried it, if the sources are in the first position, then a limiter and the paraphrase in the second position. It may be that I also tried to mix the two things arbitrarily, yes, and I only remember that it has done plenty of this penetration stuff and tried out multi-coders.

A pedestrian died after a collision with a car in Fife. The 38-year-old was taken to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy by ambulance after the collision on Broad Street in Cowdenbeath on Friday around 1:30 p.m. A 24-year-old was subsequently arrested in connection with the collision. Police are urging witnesses or drivers with dashcams who filmed the collision to come forward. Sergeant Lee Walkingshaw said: "Our investigation is ongoing and we urge anyone who was near the scene of the collision and saw the collision, as well as drivers with dashcam footage that could help with the investigation, to contact us. Anyone who can help, please call the police in Scotland on 101, quoting case number 1638, as well as the date of the collision, Friday, February 10, 2023."
Excuse me, what? A friend recommended me the mask of this brand, so I bought it, the conditioner, and the all-in-one milk. I can't say if the product works because the smell was simply unbearable. Do you know that musty smell that old buildings in ladies' toilets use to cover up the smell of *ladies*, but then it's just a sour, chemical, musty grandma smell? That's the only thing I can think of when I smell it. But taste is subjective, maybe you like the smell. My friend said that it helps even the most damaged hair, so if the smell doesn't bother you, don't worry. I know that natural products don't smell as good as synthetic ones, but I feel like more and more natural brands don't care anymore because it sells anyway and that's why everything smells like play-dough now. I've had to give up many of my favorite brands because the formula was changed to cheaper ingredients. I don't know if that was the case here or if it's a fake (I called Davines and they said no), but it smells AWFUL and I had to return it.
The news that special counsel Jack Smith has subpoenaed Mike Pence raises the question: How will the Trump team use the court to thwart this latest development in the Justice Department's investigation? The short answer is that any attempt to block Pence's subpoena by invoking executive privilege is likely to fail. First of all, the question arises as to whether a former president can even claim the privilege. Remember that Trump unsuccessfully tried to prevent the January 6th special committee from obtaining documents from the White House.

The tombs of Djehuti and Hery were inaugurated on Thursday after the completion of restoration work. The inauguration was carried out by the Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities of Egypt, Mostafa Waziri, the Ambassador of Spain in Egypt, Alvaro Iranzo, and the President of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Eloísa del Pino. Waziri explained that the two tombs were discovered during a joint Egyptian-Spanish archaeological mission of the Supreme Council of Antiquities and the CSIC, which have been collaborating since 2002. He said that the mission conducted excavation and restoration work and published research on the tombs located in the Dra Abu al-Naga region on the western bank of the Nile in Luxor. They managed to uncover many tombs, coffins, mummies, and a burial garden.
Humanity is coming out in 5 days. It's exciting, nerve-wracking, stressful, and encompasses all the good things I love about working on games. What will people think about it? I like it, but will it also be able to attract an audience with the right players? Will a community form around the user-generated content of the game? (I hope so anyway.) The story of the game, the ideas, and the questions it raises seem to be contemporary. I hope everything goes well.

How would you share personal libraries?
It was difficult to follow the book as it jumped back and forth a lot. The name also does not fit the story. The author says that several people were infected by this alien, but left out details of when and how that happened. I was sometimes confused and had to go back and reread many passages to make sure I didn't overlook anything.
(PERSON6) For the upcoming meetings, I have inquired about the demand because I have seen the (meme) project demo. They do offline subtitling. So, that is somewhat easier than what we do. They still have the same problems with segmentation and so on. But their task in translation is shortening, simply because the data is always getting shorter. And that is because their target size is the subtitles created for the hearing impaired. So there is something like a natural shortening in the data. It would be great if we could also find this kind of data where a natural shortening occurs. We would integrate them into the architecture.
Trump's precious building 40 Wall Street under "lender observation" after declining revenues: Report
Now that a new raid level in #FFXIV is coming up, I have long thought, "Man, I would like to try a real raid, but Party Finder sounds like chaos, and I will never find a static that wants me."
After not reading much for decades (except for functional, work-related non-fiction books and occasionally a self-help book), I have set myself the goal of reading 23 books in the year 2023.
I tried it, I believe with two tokens and yes, because in the first version we suspected that the token itself could also be tokenized, so I repeated it with another token that is not only intended for this purpose, because we used a trained dictionary, and this dictionary did not contain separation tokens. So I used a token that I assumed would not be tokenized into multiple parts and would only appear once. I was not certain that this token could not appear in other places in the sentence, and that is the only place where it could appear. It could be improved, yes, I agree.

Confusing action
The controller has a slimmer design that fits better in the hand and no sharp corners to get caught on. With the power cable permanently attached, it will not be damaged as quickly as the original XB1 controller. The disadvantages are: 1) The vibration effect triggered in action games feels significantly weaker. 2) The directional joystick and buttons on the controller wear out quickly. We play quite powerfully and need 2-3 controllers a year. So if we invest in controllers annually, we have to be selective and careful about which ones we buy. The controller could have more robust springs, because after just a few months, the buttons that are used the most no longer respond and the right joystick no longer stays in the middle, suddenly zooming in on overview maps or making characters run forward without touching the controls.
Very good looking guitar. Just a shame that the company doesn't know how to protect their product. Don't try to get one that isn't damaged. We have already returned 2 because they had shipping damage, and a third one was damaged too. We gave up. They are delivered in a soft, thin case with a layer of brown packing paper in a cardboard box. No padding.

It turns out, it was assumed that the call to IDirect3D::CreateViewport() would return an IDirect3DViewport3 object, which has additional methods at the end in comparison to an IDirect3DViewport that I have implemented.
(PERSON1) I could think about it. I don't really know Flask either, but yes, I can think about it.
Biologists in Minnesota rescue a trapped black bear.
As she further explained, there is a strategy behind this that most people within the Beltway would consider crazy: This is the best method to gain the trust of the press. The press knows that we do not fib like everyone else. SIGTARP will quickly become the only credible source of information in Washington about TARP. Occasionally, it may be embarrassing for us and we may say something that we could easily sweep under the rug - and others would do the same - but we shock the press with our honesty. No one else does that and sooner or later we have built a defense when we are attacked. Whatever the press hears, they will always come to us first and believe us because we prove to them that we are telling the truth. This may be the most important reason for Biden to take the path of radical accountability: There will always be moments in every presidency where it is important to have the public trust and the institutions that protect the citizens' interests. In addition, important capital can be gained by owning up to our mistakes, and here Biden can make an important difference from his political opponents. The president would do well to follow the old saying: Tell the truth - and shame the devil.
Forget me, okay. Ignore me, okay. It hurts, but you have to do it.
(PERSON1) Yes, because I think it is a method that is very easy to test, and it should always be tested in comparison with the two encoders, and I would expect that sometimes it performs better and sometimes worse than the ones with the two encoders, depending on the exact task, so what exactly is the second thing you are encoding. So if you have two copies, two rewrites of the same sentence, it may be somewhat confusing for attention, whatever, I don't know. The behavior could be different with the old sequence-to-sequence methods compared to the transformer, so with RNN it behaves differently, maybe with the transformer, yes, it is harder to train, so you may need to increase the number of warm-up sets.
I have to send an email with unformatted data to any address so that the case officer can read the email and enter it into the system to print a label.
Your case: I am not satisfied with this target because there are some defects: Accuracy: - Mistranslation: "Your case" should be translated as "Ihr Fall" or "Ihre Angelegenheit" instead of "MQM annotations" - Untranslated text: "MQM annotations" is not a correct translation and should be replaced with the accurate translation of the source text Fluency: - Grammar: The translation lacks proper grammar and structure, making it difficult to understand - Spelling: There are spelling errors in the translation that need to be corrected  Overall, the translation contains critical errors that inhibit comprehension of the text. It needs significant improvement in accuracy and fluency.
I can only say good things about this set of gift bags. I was able to wrap all my Christmas gifts with the bags, wrapping paper, and tissue paper. The product is very high quality and the different size options make it easy to choose the perfect one for each gift. I really recommend it. The seller is very nice and attentive. He contacted me after my purchase to make sure I was satisfied with the product. Clear 5 stars!
(PERSON8) No, I did not work on it. Also, [PERSON1] said, as soon as she gets the transcript, we will do it together.
I find okay, the software and the domain name that I got for my instance, quite good. But I feel like I started this instance on the wrong foot, so to speak. And I never felt comfortable with it. I will stay here a little longer and think about whether I should migrate at all.
In any case, since it applies here, I had to expand my viewport implementation to include the IDirect3DViewport3 methods in order to fix this, so that the call to the new one was valid.
Intersexuality is even recognized by TERFs and the like, as it is generally more physical and thus visible. Just as mental health is seen by many as less "real" than physical health, I somehow feel that being transsexual is just a form of intersexuality in the mind.
Biden's Department of Justice "does not want armed citizens"
Yes, so for the English with multiple accents. So, we are now, [PERSON14], in the process of putting this into a single technical solution. The current idea that [PERSON14] is working on is to create new sentences with words that have been spoken in other sentences, and he will do this with different speakers. So they will really be sentences spoken by multiple speakers, and thus the stability regarding the different accents of these speakers could also be improved. Ah, so this is a partial attempt. And later we might do something more regarding the issue with the different accents. So, these new sentences will attempt to solve two problems with one experiment. One problem is the implicit language model. The ASR system must see the largest possible set of sentences. And we will create new sentences from the text-only language model by adding the audio part, so that the language model for the ASR is better and the stability with different speakers is also improved. And yesterday I heard another idea in a presentation. It was during the training. They cut out time and frequency bands from the sound. So they were trained with impaired inputs, and that also extremely improved the stability of the system.
If you want to know, I have tried pretty much every "humane" trap on the market with very little success. I am not particularly happy to kill them, but I will not engage in any comments on the ethics of killing mice.
And I believe, only two or three sentences were correctly conjugated in the wrong context, as if the translation was wrong. And then there are some cases where the translation was completely wrong because the sentence was really wrong, and the part must be unintelligible, but that was only the case one or two times.
This is important. Please write this here in the documenter, this <unintelligible/> summary, because it is for [PERSON2]. And also [PERSON2], when you talk to [PERSON10], well and maybe also [PERSON5]. When we have this tool, we will have to send the audio to multiple ASRs or multiple workers. We will have to send the audio separately to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR and the Czech ASR, for example depending on the <other_noise/> and also to these language ID workers, and then we have to merge these outputs, and this is a tool that we do not have yet. This is the Multi-Source tool that monitors the text outputs and also follows the timestamps, and it would emit - it would probably produce the output in three separate language channels to use either silence or the correct ASR. So we need a filter for the ASRs, so that the ASR is silent when it is the wrong language, and it is the recognized text when it is the correct language. I just came up with this kind of configuration. Another configuration would be that the same sound is sent to the ASR and this language checker. This language checker is basically a part of the ASR that mutes the ASR when it is the wrong language. That is also an option. So we need to figure out which way of integrating the language ID is best for our purposes. So please continue to think about what our pipelines are. Ideally, I think there would be the least confusion in management and so on if our MT models were multilingual. If they supported different source languages and translated into English from any of these languages. They might only create a copy when the input is in English, so we would have multilingual multiple ASRs at the beginning. Everything goes into English, and then from English into all languages. And later, when [PERSON12] has a multilingual model of the ASR, this language ID would no longer be needed.

The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching as you park the plane on the red ground, but they do not move towards you, they are even motionless as you climb out of the plane and slowly approach them. The ground beneath your feet begins to shake and then rattles like in an earthquake, and you lose your footing, but the Repnids do not seem to mind. Suddenly, the rock beneath you gives way. The Repnids have dug a tunnel beneath the surface and you fall into a boiling mass of hundreds of Repnid bodies in a cave below. It ends quickly, as several pairs of fangs inject their deadly venom and the air of Dyskra contaminates your lungs. No one will ever know that you were the first human visitor of the future.
The more I read about studies on sex, gender, and psychology, the more the statement "I am male, my sex is female" seems simplified and inaccurate. It almost seems as if one would leave a part of the thesis to the TERF. I think that being transsexual means being "biologically non-binary." I am non-binary, my gender is female.
Antonio Conte has complained about the defense, and this player is currently not able to defend well either. Barnes and Maddison are very good opponents, but Porro's performance is very disappointing. Although the goal was not recognized due to offside, Barnes brought the lead back to 4-1 nine minutes before the end of the second half. Although Tottenham beat Manchester City last week, Tottenham missed the chance to move up to third place ahead of Newcastle.
I have been playing with this idea for a while already.

I asked the seller before buying if the color is not too yellow, and I was told that it is like old gold, darker. Not even close! The item looks VERY cheap. It is a super bright yellow with a lot of glitter, even more glittery. Looks great in the photo, but I wouldn't even give the real thing to a teenager.

The battery life of the one I bought on Amazon is terrible. I still can't believe that Logitech no longer offers this remote, no other is even remotely comparable. I LOVE this Harmony remote, this is already my fourth. My dog chewed up the first one, my husband knelt on the screen of the second one, and the third one still works, but has an elbow mark in the middle of the touchscreen also from my husband... I bought this as a replacement and the screen is flawless, but the included battery only lasts a few days. My other one (the third) lasts for weeks and I use my remote for everything.

Africans formed the third largest immigrant population in Oslo, with 28,020 people from Africa living in Oslo. Europeans from countries that are not part of the United Kingdom, the EU, or the EEA were the fourth largest group, with 15,566 inhabitants in Oslo. From here on, the size of the groups decreases significantly. For example, in 2022 there were only about 7,000 residents from South American countries and just over 3,000 citizens from North and Central America. Less than 700 people from Oceania lived in Oslo.
I bought the capsules in February. Recently, I tried to use them, but unfortunately one of my Keurig machines gives me an error message every time that the capsule is not compatible with the machine. Since the purchase, I have been using Donut Shop capsules in my machine and never had a problem. After taking a closer look at the capsules, I realized that the code on top of the capsule is not very legible, so I assume I received a faulty box. I bought a box of 72 capsules, so 6 packs of 12 capsules each. I even tried a capsule from each of the 6 packs, but always get the same error message. I know it's not my machine's fault because other capsules I've tried work fine. I only have problems with this shipment. Very disappointing, as my return deadline has already passed. UPDATE: I spoke with a customer service representative who refunded my money. Thank you Amazon for the wonderful customer service!
The motto at Revelations this week is Stay up all night. I've been playing with this little piece in my head for a few days now. It's definitely more romantic than dirty. Maybe I've read too many romances with impossible "cute encounters" and this is the result, but I like it. Also, I definitely want to have an orgasm on a plane one day, maybe not with a stranger.
Everything I needed
Adriana Kuch, 14, was found on February 3, two days after the disturbing video of the attack at Central Regional High School was posted online, dead in her home in Bayville. The video showed girls throwing a drink at the teenager, then kicking her and dragging her along the school corridor. They pushed Adriana into the red lockers that line the school corridors, and one of the girls in a pink shirt repeatedly hit Kuch.
I'll give 3 stars first. I don't want to leave a bad review for the seller if they don't deserve it, but this drone overheats very often. I don't know if I should contact the seller or DJI Tello, but I'll probably try both to see what they say. I like the drone, it's a cool little toy that flies better than some larger, older drones, and some of my larger drones feel more like toys than this one. However, it's also the only drone I've ever had overheating issues with, which ruins the fun of flying. I assume it's a manufacturing error that needs to be fixed as soon as possible for the product to be successful. I really hope the seller didn't send me a used drone because I paid for a new one. I can give the seller credit for the delivery, as it arrived 1 day after purchase. I will update my review after contacting the seller and DJI Tello.

Yes, I think - did Dominik do some experiments with Ivana? I think, last year or two years ago for Double Empty, where they took care of the context or the linking of the context with the input sentence and made some kind of translation at the document level. But the thing is, with this, with the linking, it's not quite certain if it has the same effect, since we are using the Multi-Encoder setting -
Great importance is placed on the development of sports infrastructure.

Let's say 200 or even 100 milliseconds. And to the HTTP server, which will queue it up for me to later process with (ASR). And the model will do some logic, some inference with it. And every time it has a new piece of transcript, it will send it back, and the user should receive the partial transcript. And it should be displayed immediately in the text field.
Yes, yes, it is very important to parallelize everything, to parallelize both the processing of the systems and the evaluation of the cell-DFF, because he would have to do this many times, there will be errors, you must repeat it quickly.
Yes, thank you.

Echidna with amethyst and magenta-colored spines. It has a medium size, an average body structure, and is muscular. Its tail is very thick. Its hair is raspberry-colored, short, and curly. Its eyes are pear-shaped and it wears scarlet cat-eye glasses. Its most interesting feature is its good deeds.
I'm just playing around with Flutter a bit. To be honest, I would hate to build my business on Google technology, but on the other hand, Google is one of the few big players with real incentives to create an appealing cross-platform experience, and you can see that.
Abe hides his worries and laughs lightly, while Tom is not afraid of crying but is less amused by rough humor. Jan will hurt you before she lets you know that she is hurt, and laughs the most when everything is chaotic. Mio knows that suffering is a constant companion in life.
I was very disappointed when I received the item because the silver part that goes around the leaf seems to be made of a very cheap plastic. What disappoints me is not the fact that it is made of plastic, but that the plastic used makes the watch look incredibly cheap. This detail has ruined the entire appearance for me. I also did not trust that it would withstand daily wear, so I returned it. I was disappointed because it seemed like a good deal, if it weren't for that. If that's not a problem for you, it could be a good deal for you. It was well packaged and arrived quickly.
I'm fed up with conservative parties and governments that present themselves as business-friendly. They are not, at least not in Alberta.

You land the aircraft with the nose up on the side of the waste dump and climb out. The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching, but they do not move towards you, they are even motionless as you slowly approach them. You pause for a moment on the hill of crumbled stone and earth, speak to them and say, "I come in peace, as a friend." It seems that they do not hear you, let alone understand, as your universal translator receives no response. You decide to use your extrasensory awareness to mentally connect with them. It is difficult to understand their thoughts; they are frighteningly foreign, and your mind recoils from making contact. You decide that a further contact would be dangerous, and you return to your aircraft, but the experience has cleansed your mind, which has been clouded since you jumped into the future. Back in the Falcon's Wing, it is quite easy for you to set a course for Earth in the year 3034 AD. Remember that you have used up another polybdenum rod in the jump.
(Person1) I mean, for text streaming we use something like Hypercore, but I'm not sure if that would work for this.
Tonight, an up-and-coming artist took some criticism badly. Partly because he was poorly trained. But it is important not to talk one's way out and simply solve the problems, especially in production when your main role needs to change. Especially in competition or rivalry.
I bought this lamp to enhance the light that my new vegetable seedlings receive from the window. I love many of the features of these lamps. Advantages: First of all, they are easy to attach to my shelf and bend into many positions, so I can make changes as my plants grow larger. The lights feel cool and have not caused any damage when touching the plants. I believe that the light has helped my vegetables. The lights are dimmable, but I only use the brightest setting. I have not used the timer yet, I prefer to turn them on and off myself. However, this can be useful in an office with houseplants or when on vacation. Disadvantages: I do not think that these lights are strong enough to serve as the main light source for grown plants. The lights are small! If the bulbs burn out, I have to buy a completely new lamp.
I want to see how these companies that facilitate transactions explain to their customers how they set their percentages. They will not talk about this on Bloomberg! But if Spotify has a good quarter, they will.

That is pretty much the only thing he asked for. But he also told us that judging by the trend of recent years, many people do not do that. They find it easier to read for the exam. No, sorry, to study for the exam -

The Kazakh Prime Minister Smajylow expressed special gratitude to the President of the Asian Athletics Association Dahlan al-Hamad for his help in the preparation and conduct of the championships. The Asian Indoor Athletics Championships took place for the first time in Kazakhstan. The tournament brought together over 500 athletes from 31 countries competing in running, relay races, long jump, high jump, triple jump, pole vault, shot put, and decathlon. The tournament is ongoing. Earlier it was reported that at the tournament, Kazakh runner Caroline Chepkoech Kipkirui won gold in the women's 3,000-meter race and Olga Safronova won silver in the women's 60-meter race.

Remote work makes many things possible. It allows people to work in comfortable spaces and not in stuffy, noisy offices. It is accessible to anyone who has an internet connection and a suitable place to work. It enables people to avoid long commutes to work, which takes time away from their day and their families.
That is something I have never said before.
(PERSON4) It's just that the evaluation of the problem for (European?) is not listed in the table because the table doesn't fit into the paper, so the <unintelligible/> coverage is always at 97 percent. It only generates the correct lemmas.
I was fortunate to spend six unforgettable months in 2011 by Nicholas' side and support a series of projects. When we met over the weekend, I was thrilled to learn about the progress, especially in planting trees and supporting agriculture. Thousands of trees were planted, and farmers were able to increase their harvests through a range of measures - from supporting the purchase of equipment to training.
This is a very beautiful skirt. The lace pattern is stylish and soft. It does not wrinkle, even after being stuffed in plastic and a cardboard box, it was still very smooth, which is really cool. The skirt can be easily worn with chic or casual clothing and has a certain vintage feeling due to the length and cut, which I really like. I think it will suit everyone. I am 5 feet 5 inches tall and weigh 130 pounds and ordered it in size S, and I would say that if you can't decide between S and M, you should definitely take the smaller size.
President's Cup: Candystripes defeat Rovers at season start in Brandywell
Yes, I was just thinking about what kind of data we are currently using for it, because, for example, if you compare the models of [ORGANISATION4] with [ORGANISATION5], they are already pretty good at these things -
A 16-year-old was charged with murdering two students at a high school in Chicago in December, the police announced on Friday. The suspect is charged with two counts of first-degree murders and two counts of attempted murder, said Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown. "We currently have no clear motive as to why a 16-year-old would shoot at other children," Brown said. The name of the suspect was not released on Friday due to his age, although Brown said he will be charged as an adult for murder and attempted murder.
Figures from the Norwegian statistics authority showed that foreigners are distributed across all districts of the city, with over 14,000 immigrants registered in Søndre Nordstrand, the southernmost district of Oslo. Many immigrants also lived in sought-after neighborhoods, with Frogner ranking fifth among the neighborhoods with the most foreigners. Stovner, Bjerke, Grorud, Østensjø, and Sagene were the remaining of the ten Oslo neighborhoods with the most residents from another country.

And that even though I haven't slept as well here in the last two nights as at home and have a bit of #MECFS because I am simply in an unfamiliar environment where I do not find my way so well and have to remember where everything is.
The owner of the Russian private military company Wagner Group, which is actively involved in the fighting in Ukraine, predicts that the war could continue for years. Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video interview released on Friday evening that Russia could take 18 months to two years to gain full control of the Donbas, the eastern industrial stronghold of Ukraine. He added that the war could continue for three years if Moscow decides to take over more areas east of the Dnieper River.
(PERSON6) And I think, if we simply - we could probably just get the data from them, because they have such a large set of videos, mainly with different domains and different native languages of the speakers on [ORGANISATION5]. And I had the idea that we could simply use a tool to download specific filtered videos from [ORGANISATION5] and create training tests, a training set, from them.

Thank you to everyone who downloaded the last Leasey update. A few very small issues have arisen. Nothing to worry about, but they will be fixed nonetheless. A small update will be created next week to address them. Yesterday, most of the time was spent installing the new update for some customers, and anyone who needs this support should have received it by now. Have a nice day!

GAZIANTEP.KAZINFORM - Kazakh rescuers continue to dig through the rubble in Turkey in search of survivors, according to Kazinform, the press service of the Kazakh Ministry of Emergency Situations. The rescuers' work is hindered by large amounts of debris and unstable buildings. So far, the Kazakh rescue team in Turkey has rescued seven survivors of the earthquake and recovered the bodies of 19 people, including a child. Medical first aid is also being provided around the clock. A significant earthquake measuring 7.7, which devastated southeastern parts of Turkey and northern Syria, occurred on Monday morning. The death toll from the strong earthquake that hit southeastern Turkey has already exceeded 20,000.
In our daily lives, we are constantly looking for ways to increase our energy and avoid burnout, especially in our jobs. This can be extremely difficult for people in the healthcare sector, which is why I asked 30 health and wellness experts the same question: "How do you manage to allocate your energy and not burn out in your profession?" Their professions ranged from infectious disease specialists to psychologists and mindfulness instructors - and they all provided great advice on how to stay motivated and on track. Despite the significant differences in their roles, there were some common themes in their responses that stood out as methods to avoid burnout.
Russia suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in the fall, as the Ukrainian military launched successful counteroffensives to reclaim broad swathes of territory in the east and south. The Kremlin has avoided making predictions about how long the fighting could continue. Instead, it says that the so-called "special military operation" will continue until its goals are achieved. Russian forces have focused on the Ukrainian provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk, which make up the Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014.
A few months ago, I bleached all of my hair and then dyed it black. Then I got highlights everywhere. A few weeks later, I put blue and green Arctic Fox hair dye in my hair, which just won't fade. I used Olaplex No. 3 here and it made everything significantly lighter, so the green and blue areas disappeared and the black color also became lighter. However, a day later I noticed a green tint in my hair. It gets worse every day and I have already used hair dye remover twice - with the same results. My hair also gets darker where I applied the hair dye. This is a great product, it just doesn't seem to last long.
In the midst of a protest outside Tate Britain, a person was arrested. There was an event for children where a drag queen told stories. According to the Metropolitan Police, a person was arrested for allegedly making a racist comment to a police officer outside the art gallery near Westminster. No injuries were reported and officers remain on the scene, according to the police.

And then I agree that there is a lot of unimportant things in this dictionary. So I asked if you could have different versions of this dictionary by only taking the words that were considered five times. And only the pronunciations that were identified three times or more, or something like that. So, in this way, these random errors, like the example with these four IBM instead of IBM. That will not happen so often. But still, you will have the variants in pronunciation, because if the person says this "alzo", if you remember, if he says this "alzo" with a "Z" 20 times in the conversation, then you will see that in the data with the "Z". And if she sometimes manages to say it correctly, then yes, you will also see that in the data. So, I want [PERSON4] to be in contact with [PERSON2]. Maybe you continue to call, right? I have to go now because I have to give the children lunch and so on. But please stay on this call and figure out together how to use the dictionary. So [PERSON4], please show [PERSON2] which is the dictionary that the system accepts. Share your screen and show it. And [PERSON2], please take a look and help with the conversion of the dictionary that you emitted into this file. One thing that is still needed is the replacement of the language model. But all these words should be known words. So [PERSON4], you need to find out which words are in the language model. And the words that are in the language model should simply be copied. So, the dictionary will have three columns. The grapheme, as it is output. One recognized. The phonemes, as suggested by [PERSON2]. And there will be several rows with different variants of phonemes. And the third column will also be the same for all, and it will be the same grapheme form again. So that's what the language model sees. And I think that these systems should be able to load it in this way. And you will probably still encounter another problem: that it is not yet designed for two large custom dictionaries. So, that is also something that needs to be tested, but please test it, both of you together. So [PERSON2] knows what he has created in the dictionary. And you know what the dictionary looks like when you create it manually, and you need to combine these two parts of knowledge. Ah, so that it works with the generated dictionary.

Every artist has been at this point before, has made the same mistakes. Good criticism helps to quickly fix the problem, and is not directed against your abilities. Assuming that you can fix the problem or find a solution.
(PERSON2) It is incomprehensible that you can improve your convenience evaluation by simply attaching a phrase-based input, and attention is like a double diagonal, so attention is not a problem, so I believe in you, but it is surprising that it did not work.

3 1/2 Stars Remedy is a love story that revolves around the brother's best friend and a second chance. It is a unique story and the main character (Grady) must do everything to win back Collins and prove that he is the man for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had a great night together. Collins thought she finally got everything she had always dreamed of, the brother's best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning and never heard from him, everything changed drastically. Now Grady is back and he's not going to leave, doing everything in his power to prove why he left and that he won't give up this time. I really liked the idea of this story very much and sometimes even Grady, but he really got on my nerves. I completely understand why he had to leave after that night, but couldn't he at least send Collins a letter explaining the reason? Instead, he left her confused and hurt for years and then expected her to welcome him back with open arms? Is he crazy?! Collins is rightfully angry, upset, hurt, etc. She rightfully argued with him when he wanted her back, and rightfully continued with her life. I admire her strength because Grady didn't give up. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong and she protected her heart, and I admire her for that. Sure, she loves Grady, but she was afraid and hesitant to let him back into her life. Who wouldn't be after what he did to her? Of the two, I definitely prefer her character. She let things run at her own pace, and when she was ready to listen, she did. There is a lot of fear in this book and I enjoyed watching them get closer again after Collins started to forgive Grady. I just wished Grady didn't come across as so whiny and had more understanding. He always said he understood, but sometimes he was a bit too pushy, and then very gentle at the end. In the end, I liked him as much as Collins, but at the beginning of the book, I had trouble reading his perspective because I couldn't connect with his character. So I didn't particularly like the first part of the book, but the second part? I loved it, hence my rating. If you like love stories about second chances and the brother's best friend, you might enjoy this book. I just had initial problems with Grady and how he dealt with some of the things he had done.
But did I love it? Definitely!
Derry City emerged victorious from the President's Cup after winning 2-0 against Shamrock Rovers. The FAI Cup title holder defeated last season's winner at Brandywell thanks to goals from Will Patching and Michael Duffy in the first half. The Hoops faded in the second half, but Ruaidhri Higgins' shots were strong enough to secure the win. Derry traveled to St. Patrick's Athletics for the first game of the season next Friday. Patching's side volley put Derry ahead after 23 minutes - the midfielder scored the first goal after the Foylesiders had played 2-1 against the eventual champions last February.
There was particular dissatisfaction that Leigh Drennan, the chair of Labour North West and advisor to Warrington North MP Charlotte Nichols, who supports Jeremy Corbyn, was not placed on the longlist to attempt to regain seats from the Conservatives, despite being nominated by four major trade unions. Reeves said she had nothing to do with the selection of candidates, but added: "I know it is very important that we have strict processes for who can be placed on the longlist and who can be placed on the shortlist."
In recent years, certain Hindu hardliners have raided businesses selling Valentine's Day items, burned cards and gifts, and driven hand-holding couples out of restaurants and parks because they insisted that the day violates traditional values and promotes sexual freedom. Hindu nationalist groups like Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal have stated that such raids help to strengthen Hindu identity. Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi say that his government is pursuing a Hindu agenda and seeking to establish the dominance of Hinduism in a secular nation known for its diversity. Nearly 80% of the nearly 1.4 billion people are Hindus, while Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Jains make up the majority of the rest.
The hatred for literature classes is even greater: I love reading. I read most of the classics before my eighteenth birthday - although that rather reflects life at the end of the world, in my desperation I also read the Encyclopedia Britannica from 1979.

In July 2022, California officials filed a lawsuit against Kilcher for two crimes related to workers' compensation fraud. She was accused of illegally receiving over $96,000 in disability payments between October 2019 and September 2021. This period also includes some months during which Kilcher was working on "Yellowstone," despite the actress claiming she was too injured to work. Kilcher turned herself in and was brought to court in May.

It's ThinkPad day!! I came home during my lunch break and saw it outside UwU. I wish I could take it to work to set up more. But that will have to wait until this evening.
Dear Bluetooth instead of WLAN connection! I bought this product for my wife in October 2017. At that time, we were in the middle of moving and living in a hotel. I couldn't connect the scale to the hotel's WLAN. So I decided to wait until we moved into our own house and I could set up my own WLAN. March 2018, I set up my WLAN and the scale still won't connect. Every time I try, I get an error message. Even when I'm only 10 feet away from the WLAN unit. I have also unsuccessfully followed the setup videos on YouTube. When I bought the device, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the WLAN router to communicate with the phone. The system is limited to the router connection... which is usually not close to the bedroom, unlike a phone! Due to the WLAN connection, I would not recommend this scale to anyone. Instead, look for systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I will also replace it with a scale that has Bluetooth connection.
(PERSON1) and then we will find out which packages we need to install in the Petri environment.
Wazir explained that these tombs belong to significant individuals who lived at the beginning of the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom - one of the most important periods of Ancient Egypt. He said that the layout of the tombs is T-shaped, a style commonly used in tombs of the 18th Dynasty. These consist of an entrance area, a columned hall leading into a burial shaft, and walls that show clear inscriptions. Waziri added that Djehuti was the overseer of the state treasury and supervised the work of craftsmen and artists during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut.

The circumstances regarding O'Hara were "quite extraordinary," said Reeves, but she admitted: "The Labour Party and all political parties have important things to learn regarding the selection of candidates. But I would also say that we have seen a constant undermining of political standards in this parliament, not least through a succession of prime ministers and fines and parties and standards that fall far below expectations." She added: "One thing I can say about the Labour Party is that if someone does something wrong, they can no longer be the party leader. And that is simply not the case with the Conservative Party."
So this is an important matter that we should have encountered months ago. Remember, I have been telling you since August that we want to evaluate with a later test set. And every time, all of you... It's not just about you personally, [PERSON8]. There were other things, obviously. But every time you thought about it, you thought, "This will be easy, we'll just do it." And only when you actually do it, you see all the problems. So, this is known, quite normal. It's always like this. So this is a message for everyone. Before you try it, you never know what the problem will be. For example, the call I had when someone was interviewing me, they wanted to record the video. Zoom has never worked as poorly for me as it did today during the recording. So, before you do it, you can't say whether it will work or not. And here we encounter problems with converting file formats. Hopefully we will get the numbers quickly. So, have you had any word error rates so far?
I found out the hard way that local TV station websites offer the absolute worst experience on the internet in 2023. Pop-ups, autoplay videos, animations, pop-overs, and ads, ads, ads. I know they make money from ads, but all this junk seems counterproductive if it drives people away. It's still the case even now that goatse.cx is gone, although it would be a close race to the bottom between goatse and, let's say, khou.com, where I tried to watch a video Wendy sent me.
(PERSON3) I think this is really an interesting question, whether we can use the restrictions to enforce the gender of the speaker in the translation.
Jami handed him the note as they passed each other just before guard duty. She was on her way to the wall, he had just finished work. He looked back to watch her go and to make sure they weren't seen. She didn't turn around. He waited until he had reached the darkness of the berth before pulling out the note and reading it in a beam of light shining through the blackout curtains. A word printed in block letters. He stared at it for a long time, trying to remain calm.
One of the fans was not running smoothly right after unpacking. The speed control is really strange: when you set it to 100%, the fans turn off, so you have to set it to 100% and then reduce it slightly until they turn back on. The build quality is mediocre, but that seems to be normal for products in this price range. The stands that hold the laptop have come off a few times... They can be reattached, but it happens so often that it's annoying. On a positive note, I can say that the fan position is ideal for laptops that draw air through ventilation slots on the top of the laptop. Many other coolers have fans in the middle and provide little extra airflow for laptops with this type of cooling.
Yes, if the context is too short, and because I make decisions based on a very short context for this very low latency, then it really commits to something that, for example, finds out in a second or two, oh, well, that was really a bad translation. So it tries to use a different wording. For example, to specify the matter. So, actually, I really liked it. I like some of the translations. I was really surprised, although you could see that the model made mistakes on the first try, it really wanted to make some kind of correction. And it sounded really very fluent, which I think is also important. If you really demand a low latency, then I think that even a slightly lower quality is okay if it is fluent. Because if you have poor translation quality and the translation is not fluent, then I think the translation is simply meaningless. But if the quality is lower because the translation, when you read everything, you get the same information, but the wording is just bad because it uses more words and corrections and stuff like that. So, I think this is totally fine for simultaneous, as long as you don't lose any information. And for which language pairs do you have these results, some examples? I would like to look at that, just out of curiosity.

It's crazy to do weightlifting without really knowing what your one-repetition maximum is because that's one of the main ways people track their progress. I train alone in my bedroom, without a coach or even a weight rack. Just me and a barbell with a bunch of weights. I do bench presses on my bed. When I try to find my one-repetition maximum, I probably don't have enough weights to reach my maximum, or conversely, I could seriously injure myself. Anyway, today I'll add a few more weights. Still feels good.

The incident occurs after the number of refugees and asylum seekers crossing the English Channel to Britain in boats increases. Police have arrested 15 people after anti-refugee demonstrations outside a hotel near the English city of Liverpool, which is used to accommodate asylum seekers, turned violent. According to Merseyside Police Station, a police officer and two civilians suffered minor injuries during the turmoil on Friday evening in Knowsley. Police said some protesters threw objects and set a police car on fire. The arrested individuals, aged between 13 and 54, were detained "due to violent disturbances." Merseyside Police Commissioner Emily Spurrell told Radio City, "It was incredibly dangerous and there were some injuries among the police officers."
