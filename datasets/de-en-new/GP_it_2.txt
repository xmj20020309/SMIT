Your case: Source: Donald Trump's heavily mortgaged skyscraper at 40 Wall Street is under "lender watch" amid falling income and rising costs, Bloomberg reported Friday. The vacancy rate at the 72-story building — Trump's most valuable — jumped to nearly 18% in the third quarter of last year, according to a monthly filing on the remaining $126.5 million mortgage, Bloomberg reported. Expenses have reportedly risen 11% since the mortgage began in 2015. Trump has often bragged about the building, which he acquired in 1995 and which was valued at $540 million in 2015.
I'd like this ring very much – but I couldn't wear it all the time! :( This ring was very beautiful. I liked the design and how heavy it felt; it looked expensive and fit very comfortably! The only reason I'm only giving it 3 stars and ultimately returned it is because I realized I wouldn't be able to wear it all the time. I like to wear my rings all the time, which is why I always make sure to buy them in sterling silver. I know some people have said that their rings tarnished after a while, but I wore mine for a week straight – even when washing my hands – and I couldn't see any tarnishing. The problem I had, interestingly, was that the inside of the ring made my finger white and damp – kind of like when you wear a plaster for a long time. This happened even when I made sure that both my ring and my finger were completely dry. I don't know why this happened, and it's never happened with any other ring, but I didn't feel comfortable with it and so I decided that this ring wasn't the right one for me. :( Too bad, because I really liked it! So if you're buying this ring because you want to wear it occasionally, I can only recommend it!! You won't be disappointed!
Oh yes, I just don't know if you noticed when we were talking about [PERSON1], but one thing is that the (beat) is better, but the other thing is that the lemmas are really manually inflected, but that's, that's another, no, no problem, it's even good that it's correct, yes. So, I thought it might be. But I'm not sure if we have any test data for it, but we could try playing around with the models, with some kind of style transfer?

But that's, I'm just describing it vaguely, because I don't have a clear idea myself of how to do it, but it could have been an interesting, different scenario.

At the other end of the spectrum, only 184 foreign residents called Marka their home, and just over 700 lived in the city center. Ullern, Vestre Aker, and Nordstrand were the other districts with the fewest foreign residents. However, they had more immigrants than Oslo city center and Marka. Immigrants from EU and EEA countries, as well as the United Kingdom, mostly lived in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Old Oslo, and St. Hanshaugen. While many citizens from Asia, including Turkey, also lived in Old Oslo (5,837), the majority were registered in the districts of Alna, Stovner, and Søndre Nordstrand.

Your case: Source: The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources came to the rescue of a very unlucky bear after it became trapped in a ditch. The bear had been taking refuge in a roadside culvert near Wannaska, Minnesota, according to a Facebook post from the department. But as the snow began to melt, the water level in the culvert rose and the bear became trapped in deep snow and ice, the department said. Department staff responded quickly and helped the bear escape. The department's bear biologist, Andrew Tri, "examined the bear and declared it healthy but lethargic – apparently from being roused from its hibernation," the Facebook post said. The department then transported the bear to a state wildlife management area so it could continue its hibernation. The weary predator was estimated to be 6 years old and between 375 and 400 pounds.

Your case: Source: The controller has a slimmer design that fits better in the hand and has no sharp corners to snag on. With the permanently attached power cord, it also doesn't get damaged as quickly as the original XB1 controller. The downsides are: 1) The vibration effect, which is triggered in action games, feels significantly weaker. 2) The directional joystick and buttons of the controller wear out quickly. We play quite forcefully and need 2-3 controllers a year. So, if we invest in controllers annually, we have to be picky and take good care of which ones we buy. The controller could have more solid springs, because after only a few months the buttons that are used the most no longer respond and the right joystick no longer stays in the middle, so it suddenly zooms in on overview maps or makes characters run forward without touching the controls.

So if you have two copies, two paraphrases of the same sentence, it might be confusing for the attention, whatever, I don't know. The behavior could also be different with the old sequence-to-sequence methods compared to the transformer, so with RNN it behaves differently, maybe with the transformer it's, yeah, harder to train, so you might have to increase the number of warm-ups, the warm-up sentences.

And later we might do something more about the thing with the different accents. So, these new sentences will try to solve two problems with one experiment. One problem is the implicit language model. So the ASR system needs to see the largest possible set of sentences. And we will create new sentences from the text-only language model by adding the sound part, so that the language model for the ASR is better and also the stability with different speakers is improved. And yesterday I heard another idea in a lecture. It was during the training. They cut out time and frequency bands from the sound.

Your case: Source: (PERSON4) And I think only two or three sentences were correctly inflected in the wrong context, as if the translation were wrong. And then there are some cases where the translation was completely wrong because the sentence was really wrong, and the part has to be <unintelligible>, but that was only the case once or twice.
Your case: Source: (PERSON11) This is important. Please write this down in the documentor, this <unintelligible> summary, because it's for [PERSON2]. And also [PERSON2], when you talk to [PERSON10], well, maybe [PERSON5] too. If we have this tool, we need to send the audio to multiple ASRs or multiple workers <unintelligible>. We will have to send the audio separately to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR and the Czech ASR, for example depending on the <other noise> and also to this language ID worker, and then we need to merge these outputs, and this is a tool that we don't have yet. This is the multi-source tool that monitors the text outputs and also follows the timestamps, and it would emit - it would probably produce the output in three separate language channels, to use either silence or the correct ASR. So we need a filter for the ASRs, so that the ASR is silent when it is the wrong language, and it is the recognized text when it is the correct language. I just came up with this kind of configuration. Another configuration would be that the same sound is sent to the ASR and this language checker. This language checker is basically a part of the ASR that mutes the ASR when it is the wrong language. That is also an option. So we need to figure out which way of integrating language ID is best for our purposes. So please keep thinking about what our pipelines are. Ideally, I think there would be the least confusion in management and so on if our MÜ models were multilingual. If they supported different output languages and translated from any of these languages into English. They might only create a copy if the input was in English, so we would have multilingual multiple ASRs at the beginning. Everything goes into English, and then from English into all languages. And later, when [PERSON12] has a multilingual model of the ASR, this language ID would no longer be needed.

Europeans from countries that are not part of the United Kingdom, the EU or the EEA were the fourth largest group, with 15,566 residents in Oslo. From here, the size of the groups decreases significantly. For example, in 2022 there were only just under 7,000 citizens from South American countries and just over 3,000 nationals from North and Central America. Less than 700 people from Oceania lived in Oslo.
Your case: Source: I bought the pods in February. Recently, I tried to use them, but unfortunately, one of my Keurig machines gives me an error message every time that the pod is not compatible with the machine. I have been using Donut Shop pods in my machine since I bought it and have never had a problem. After taking a closer look at the coffee pods, I noticed that the code on top of the pod is not very legible, so I assume I received a faulty carton. I bought a carton of 72 pods, so 6 packs of 12 pods. I even tried a pod from all 6 packs, but I always get the same error message. I know it's not my machine because other pods I've tried work without any problems. I'm only having problems with this delivery. Very disappointing, as my return window has already expired.

Your case: Source: I'm giving 3 stars for now. I don't want to leave the seller a bad review if they don't deserve it, but this drone overheats very often. I don't know if I should contact the seller or DJI Tello directly, but I'll probably try both to see what they say. I like the drone, it's a cool little toy that flies better than some bigger, older drones and some of my bigger drones feel more like a toy than this one. However, it's also the only drone I've ever had problems with overheating and that spoils the fun of flying. I'm assuming for now that this is a manufacturing defect that needs to be fixed as soon as possible if the product is to be successful. I really hope the seller didn't send me a used drone because I paid for a new one. I can praise the seller for the delivery, as it arrived 1 day after purchase. I will update my review after I have contacted the seller and DJI Tello.

I couldn't connect the scale to the hotel's WLAN. So I decided to wait until we moved into our own house and I could set up my own WLAN. March 2018, I set up my WLAN and the scale still won't connect. Every time I try, I get an error message. Even when I'm only 10 feet away from the WLAN unit. I have also unsuccessfully followed the setup videos on YouTube. When I bought the device, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the WLAN router to communicate with the phone. The system is limited to the router connection... which is usually not near the bedroom, unlike a phone! Because of the WLAN connection, I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone. Instead, look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication.

It's always like that. So this is a message for everyone. Before you try it, you never know what the problem will be. So, for example, the call I had when someone interviewed me, so they wanted to record the video. Zoom has never worked so badly for me as it did today during the recording. So, before you do it, you can't tell if it will work or not. And here we encounter problems with file format conversion. So hopefully we'll get the numbers soon. So, do you have any word error rates so far?
Your case: Source: I found out the hard way that local TV station websites offer the absolute worst experience on the internet in 2023. Pop-ups, auto-playing videos, animations, pop-overs, and ads, ads, ads. I know they make their money from ads, but all this crap seems counterproductive when it drives people away. This is even the case now that goatse.cx is gone, although it would be a close race to the bottom between goatse and, say, khou.com, where I tried to watch a video Wendy sent me.
Your case: Source: (PERSON3) I think it's a really interesting question whether we can use the limitations to force this kind of speaker gender in the translation.  Target: Do not provide any explanations or text apart from the translation.
Your case: Source: Jami handed him the note as they passed each other on the way shortly before the dog watch. She was on her way to the wall, he had just finished work. He looked behind him to see her go and to make sure they weren't seen. She didn't turn around. He waited until he was in the darkness of the bunk before he pulled out the note and read it in a ray of light that shone through the blackout curtains. One word printed in block letters. He stared at it for a long time, trying to stay calm:
Your case: Source: One of the fans wasn't running smoothly right out of the box. The speed control is really weird: when you set it to 100%, the fans turn off, so you have to set it to 100% and then back it down a bit until they turn on again. The build quality is mediocre, but that seems to be normal for products in this price range. The stands that hold the laptop have come off a few times already... They can be plugged back in, but it happens so often that it's annoying. On the positive side, I can say that the fan position is ideal for laptops that draw air in through vents on the top of the laptop. Many other coolers have fans in the middle and offer little extra airflow to laptops with such cooling.
Your case: Source: (PERSON2) Yes, if the context is too short, and because I make decisions based on a very short context for this very low latency, then it really commits to something that, for example, finds out in a second or two, oh, well, that was really a bad translation. So it tries to use a different wording. For example, to specify the matter. So, actually I really liked it. I like some of the translations. I was really surprised, although you could see that the model made mistakes on the first try, it really wanted to make some kind of correction. And it really sounded very fluent, which I think is also important. If you really want low latency, then I think even slightly lower quality is fine if it's fluent. Because if you have bad translation quality and the translation is not fluent, then I think the translation is just pointless. But if the quality is lower because the translation, when you read everything, that you get the same information, but the wording is just bad because it uses more words and corrections and stuff like that. So, I think that's perfectly fine for simultaneous as long as you don't lose information. And for which language pairs do you have these results, some examples? I'd like to take a look at that, just out of curiosity.

Your case: Source: It's crazy to do weightlifting but also have no real idea what your one-rep max is, because that's one of the main ways people track their progress. I train alone in my bedroom, with no spotter or even a weight rack. Just me and a barbell with a bunch of weights. I do bench presses on my bed. If I try to figure out my one-rep max, I probably don't have enough weights to reach my max, or conversely I could seriously injure/kill myself. Whatever, I'm adding some more weights today. Still feels good.
Your case: Source: Curious, I wanted to be unbiased and see how Google Maps and Apple Maps compare on my test iPhone (my daily driver is an Android device, so I rarely use an iPhone).
