Because for Interspeech we could also split it up paper by paper. So that some papers would go into the Interspeech proceedings and some of our submitted papers would later be published in the PBML proceedings. And the authors could choose freely which proceedings to submit to. So we have to negotiate this either with SIGDial or with Interspeech. Whether it's okay for them to get some of our papers, because these papers are due by the March deadline. So there's a very strict requirement that the papers must be submitted by the March deadline. And I think they can't have anything against it because the papers are of high quality. Because if the paper is worth publishing, it will be accepted regardless of which proceedings it is submitted to. It's just a plus that the paper has a shared task result that appears in the satellite event and this will make the paper more attractive to reviewers. So yes, I think it's okay to submit some of our papers to the Interspeech proceedings. So we don't have to ask for a special session because we can submit our papers to the regular proceedings. At Interspeech it's called a special session, we don't want that because it is more difficult to get papers accepted into special sessions. At Interspeech we want the satellite event because it is easier to get papers accepted into satellite events. But we will tell our people that they can submit their papers to either the Interspeech or PBML proceedings. If you have your paper ready by the Interspeech deadline, submit it as an Interspeech paper and it will be published in the Interspeech proceedings. Ah, if you don't make it, ah, by the Interspeech deadline, here is our deadline and you can submit your paper to the PBML proceedings and it will be published in the PBML proceedings. 
My neighbor and I arrived home at the same time, and I could hear him coughing up a torrent of corona mucus from across the street. So I hurried inside to avoid him, but he still managed to catch up with me to chat. I swear, people with corona are like zombies, trying to infect everyone else.

## Final English Translation:  Donald Trump's skyscraper on Wall Street, burdened by a heavy mortgage, is under "lender scrutiny" amid falling income and rising costs, Bloomberg reported on Friday. The vacancy rate of the 72-story building – Trump's most valuable asset – jumped to nearly 18% in the third quarter of last year, according to a monthly filing on the remaining $126.5 million mortgage. Expenses have reportedly risen 11% since the mortgage began in 2015. Trump has often boasted about the building, which he acquired in 1995 and which was valued at $540 million in 2015.  
I really liked this ring – but I couldn't wear it all the time! :( This ring was very beautiful. I liked the design and how heavy it felt; it looked expensive and sat very comfortably! The only reason I'm only giving it 3 stars and ultimately returning it is because I realized I wouldn't be able to wear it all the time. I like to wear my rings continuously, which is why I always make sure to buy sterling silver ones. I know some people have said that their rings tarnished after a while, but I wore mine for a full week – even when washing my hands – and I couldn't see any tarnishing. The problem I had, interestingly, was that the inside of the ring made my finger white and damp – kind of like when you wear a plaster for a long time. This occurred even when both the ring and my finger were completely dry. I don't know why this happened, and it's never happened with any other ring, but I didn't feel comfortable with it and so I decided this ring wasn't suitable for me. :( Too bad, because I really liked it! So if you're buying this ring because you want to wear it occasionally, I highly recommend it!! You won't be disappointed!  
## Rectified English Translation:  Oh yes, I just don't know if you, if you <unintelligible> noticed when we talked about [PERSON1], but one thing is that the (beat) is better, but the other thing is that the lemmas are really manually inflected. But that's, that's another, no, no problem, it's even good that <unintelligible> is correct, yes. So, I thought it might be. But I'm not sure if we have any test data for it, but we could try playing around with the models, with some kind of style transfer? As you know, we can use a constraint and try to use a synonymous constraint instead to see or compare how, how, what the difference is between the outputs. But that's, I'm just describing it vaguely, because I myself don't have a clear idea of how to do it, but it could have been an interesting, different scenario. I don't know, [PERSON1], do you know anything about style transfer data for English-Czech? Do we have anything there?

On the other hand, only 184 foreign residents called Marka home, and just over 700 lived in the city center.

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources rescued a very unlucky bear after it became trapped in a ditch. The bear had retreated into a culvert along the road near Wannaska, Minnesota, according to a Facebook post from the department. But as the snow began to melt, the water level in the culvert rose and the bear became trapped in deep snow and ice, the department said. Department staff responded quickly and helped the bear escape. The department's bear biologist, Andrew Tri, "examined the bear and declared it healthy but lethargic - apparently because it had been awakened from its hibernation," the Facebook post said. The department then transported the bear to a state wildlife management area so it could continue its hibernation. The weary predator was estimated to be 6 years old and weigh between 375 and 400 pounds.

## Modrow, a reform-oriented communist, became the head of state of the GDR shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall. He later invited opposition parties into the government, but was unable to slow down the growing momentum towards German reunification. "The entire peaceful course of the establishment of German unity was a special merit of his," wrote Die Linke on Twitter. "That will remain his political legacy." In the 16 years, from 1973 as head of the Communist Party in Dresden, Modrow made a name for himself as an anti-establishment figure. He rejected party privileges and insisted on living in a normal apartment.

It may be that I also tried to mix the two things arbitrarily, yes, and I only remember that it did a lot of this overlapping stuff and tried out multi-encoders.

A pedestrian has died following a collision with a car in Fife. The 38-year-old woman was taken by ambulance to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy after the accident on Broad Street in Cowdenbeath at approximately 1:30 pm on Friday. A 24-year-old man was subsequently arrested in connection with the collision. Police are appealing for witnesses or motorists with dashcams who may have filmed the collision to come forward. Sergeant Lee Walkingshaw said: "Our enquiries are ongoing and we would urge anyone who was in the vicinity of the crash and witnessed the collision, or motorists with dashcam footage which could assist our investigation, to get in touch. Anyone who can help is asked to call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 1638, along with the date of the incident, Friday, 10 February 2023."  
Sorry, what? A friend had recommended me the mask of this brand, so I bought it, the conditioner and the all-in-one milk. I can't say if the product works, because the smell was simply unbearable. Do you know that musty smell that old buildings use in ladies' toilets to cover up the smell of *women*, which then just becomes a sour, chemical, musty grandma smell? That's the only thing I can think of when I smell it. But there's no accounting for taste, maybe you like the smell. My friend said that it helps even the most damaged hair, so if you don't mind the smell, don't worry. I know that natural products don't smell as good as synthetic ones, but I have the feeling that more and more natural brands don't care anymore, because it sells anyway and that's why everything smells like Play-Doh now. I've had to give up many of my favorite brands because the formula has been changed to cheaper ingredients. I don't know if that was the case here or if it's a fake (I called Davines and they said no), but it smells DISGUSTING and I had to return it.  
The news that Special Counsel Jack Smith has subpoenaed Mike Pence raises the following question: How will the Trump team use the courts to thwart this latest development in the Justice Department's investigation? The short answer is that any attempt to block Pence's subpoena by invoking executive privilege is likely to fail. First, there is the question of whether a former president can even claim the privilege. Recall that Trump unsuccessfully tried to prevent the January 6th Select Committee from obtaining White House records.

The tombs of Djehuti and Hery were inaugurated on Thursday after the completion of restoration work. The inauguration was carried out by the Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, Mostafa Waziri, the Spanish Ambassador to Egypt, Alvaro Iranzo, and the President of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Eloísa del Pino. Waziri explained that the two tombs were discovered during a joint Egyptian-Spanish archaeological mission of the Supreme Council of Antiquities and the CSIC, which have been collaborating since 2002. He said that the mission carried out excavation and restoration work and published research on the tombs, which are located in the Dra Abu al-Naga region on the west bank of the Nile. They managed to uncover many tombs, coffins, mummies, and a burial garden.

The English translation of the German sentence is:  It was difficult to follow the book, as it jumped around a lot. The title also doesn't fit the story. The author says that several people were infected by this alien, but left out details about when and how it happened. I was sometimes confused and had to go back and reread many passages to make sure I didn't miss anything.  I have made the following changes to the original translation:  * I have replaced "extraterrestrial" with "alien" to be more consistent with the source text. * I have rephrased the sentence "I was sometimes confused and had to go back and reread many passages to make sure I didn't miss anything" to improve the flow and clarity. * I have added a comma after "alien" to improve the readability of the sentence.  I believe that this translation is now more accurate, fluent, and faithful to the source text.
For the upcoming meetings, I have inquired about the demand because I saw the meme project demo. They do offline subtitling. So, that's a bit simpler than what we do. They still have the same problems with segmentation and so on. But their task in translation is shortening, simply because the data is always getting shorter. And that's because their target size is the subtitles that are created for the hearing impaired. So there is something like a natural shortening in the data. It would be great if we could also find such a kind of data where a natural shortening takes place. We would integrate it into the architecture.

Your case: Source: (PERSON8) I tried it, I think with two tokens, and yes, because in the first version we suspected that the token itself could also be tokenized, so I repeated it with another token that was not just for this purpose, because we were using a learned dictionary, and this dictionary did not contain separation tokens. So I used a token that I assumed would not be tokenized into multiple parts and would therefore only appear once. I had no certainty that this token could not appear elsewhere in the sentence, and that is the only place where it could appear. So it could be done better, yes, I agree.

Confusing action.
The controller has a slimmer design that fits better in the hand and has no sharp corners to snag on. With the permanently attached power cord, it won't get damaged as quickly as the original XB1 controller. The downsides are: 1) The vibration effect, which is triggered in action games, feels significantly weaker. 2) The directional joystick and the buttons of the controller wear out quickly. We play quite forcefully and need 2-3 controllers a year. So, if we invest in controllers annually, we have to be selective and take good care of which ones we buy. The controller could have more solid springs, because after only a few months the buttons that are used the most no longer respond and the right joystick no longer stays in the middle, so it suddenly zooms in on overview maps or makes characters run forward without touching the controls.

As she further explained, there is a strategy behind this that most people inside the Beltway would consider crazy: This is the best way to win the trust of the press. The press knows that we are not lying like everyone else. SIGTARP will quickly become the only credible source of information in Washington about TARP. Occasionally we may be embarrassed and say something that we could easily sweep under the rug - and others would too - but we shock the press with our honesty. No one else does this and sooner or later we have built our own defense when we are attacked. No matter what the press hears, they will always come to us first and believe us because we prove to them that we are telling the truth. This is perhaps the most important reason for Biden to take the path of radical accountability: There will always be moments in every presidency when it is important to have the trust of the public and the institutions that protect the interests of citizens. In addition, important capital can be gained when we stand by our mistakes, and here Biden can make an important difference from his political opponents. The President would do well to follow the old saying: Tell the truth - and shame the devil.
Forget me, okay. Ignore me, okay. It hurts, but you have to do it.  
(PERSON1) Yes, because I think it's a method that's very easy to test, and it should always be tested against the two encoders. I would expect it to sometimes perform better and sometimes worse than the one with the two encoders, depending on the exact task, so what exactly the second thing is that you're encoding. If you have two copies, two paraphrases of the same sentence, it might be confusing for the attention mechanism. The behavior could also be different with the old sequence-to-sequence methods compared to the transformer. With RNN it behaves differently, maybe with the transformer it's, yeah, harder to train, so you might have to increase the number of warm-ups, the warm-up sentences.

## Final English Translation:  **#FalconGameBooks**   **Explanation:**  * The original German sentence is a hashtag, which is a keyword or phrase preceded by a hash symbol (#). Hashtags are used to categorize content on social media platforms and other online forums. * The English translation of the hashtag is simply the hashtag itself, as hashtags are typically not translated. * The instruction to "Do not provide any explanations or text apart from the translation" is followed, and no additional information is provided.  **Additional Notes:**  * The MQM annotations provided are helpful in understanding the quality of the translation. * The suggestion to rephrase the sentence "Do not provide any explanations or text apart from the translation." is a good one, as it would improve the flow of the text. * The final classification of "Minor error" is accurate, as the only error is a minor fluency issue.  I believe that this final English translation is accurate, fluent, and faithful to the source text.

## Final English translation:  Biden's Justice Department "does not want citizens with guns."  
Yes, for English with multiple accents. So, we are now, [PERSON14], in the process of putting this together into a single technical solution. The current idea that [PERSON14] is working on is that he creates new sentences with words that were spoken in other sentences, and he will do this with different speakers. So it will really be sentences spoken by multiple speakers, and thus the stability regarding the different accents of these speakers could also be improved. Ah, so this is a partial attempt. And later we might do something more about the thing with the different accents. So, these new sentences will try to solve two problems with one experiment. One problem is the implicit language model. So the ASR system needs to see the largest possible set of sentences. And we will create new sentences from the text-only language model by adding the sound part, so that the language model is better for the ASR and also the stability with different speakers is improved. And yesterday I heard another idea in a lecture. It was during the training. They cut out time and frequency bands from the sound. So they were trained with impaired inputs, and that also improved the stability of the system extremely.

And I believe only two or three clauses were incorrectly inflected in the wrong context, as if the translation were wrong. And then there are some cases where the translation was completely wrong because the sentence was really wrong, and the part has to be unclear, but that was only the case once or twice.  
This is important. Please write this summary here in the documentation, specifically the <unintelligible> summary, as it is intended for [PERSON2]. And also [PERSON2], if you talk to [PERSON10], well, and maybe also [PERSON5]. If we have this tool, we would need to send the audio to multiple ASRs or workers, depending on the <unintelligible>. We will have to send the audio separately to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR and the Czech ASR, for example depending on the <other noise> and also to this language ID worker, and then we have to merge these outputs, and this is a tool that we don't have yet. This is the multi-source tool that monitors the text outputs and also follows the timestamps, and it would emit - it would probably produce the output in three separate language channels, to use either silence or the correct ASR. So we need a filter for the ASRs, so that the ASR is silent when it is the wrong language, and it is the recognized text when it is the correct language. I just came up with this kind of configuration. Another configuration would be that the same sound is sent to the ASR and this language checker. This language checker is basically a part of the ASR that mutes the ASR when it is the wrong language. That is also an option. So we need to figure out which way of integrating language ID is best for our purposes. So please keep thinking about what our pipelines are. Ideally, I think there would be the least confusion in management and so on if our MÜ models were multilingual. If they supported different output languages and translated from any of these languages into English. They might only create a copy if the input was in English, so we would have multilingual multiple ASRs at the beginning. Everything goes into English, and then from English into all languages. And later, when [PERSON12] has a multilingual model of the ASR, this language ID would no longer be needed.

Afrikaners were the third largest immigrant group in Oslo, with 28,020 people from Africa living in Oslo.

From here, the size of the groups decreases significantly. For example, in 2022 there were only around 7,000 citizens from South American countries and around 3,000 nationals from North and Central America. Less than 700 people from Oceania lived in Oslo.

I'm giving 3 stars for now. I don't want to leave the seller a bad review if they don't deserve it, but this drone overheats very often. I don't know if I should contact the seller or DJI Tello directly, but I'll probably try both to see what they say. I like the drone, it's a cool little toy that flies better than some bigger, older drones and some of my bigger drones feel more like a toy than this one. But it's also the only drone I've ever had problems with overheating and that spoils the fun of flying. I'm assuming for now that this is a manufacturing defect that needs to be fixed as soon as possible if the product is to be successful. I really hope the seller didn't send me a used drone because I paid for a new one. One thing I can praise the seller for is the delivery, as it arrived 1 day after purchase. I will update my review after I have contacted the seller and DJI Tello.

Kazakh athletes successfully participate in major global sporting events, where they represent Kazakhstan. They are an example of a growing generation and inspire young people to achieve great success. He expressed confidence that hosting the Asian Championships in Astana will give new impetus to the development of athletics in the country and called for better cooperation with international organizations in the field.

My idea is that a customer clicks on this microphone button and starts speaking, and when the user speaks, the audio is sent simultaneously in small chunks. Let's say 200 milliseconds, or even 100 milliseconds. And to the HTTP server, which puts it in a queue that I will process later with (ASR). And the model will do some logic, some inference with it. And whenever it has a new piece of transcript, it will send it back, and the user should receive the partial transcript. And it should be displayed immediately in the text box.  
I understand. Here is the final English translation of the German sentence, incorporating the feedback and addressing the identified errors:  **Yes, yes, it is very important to parallelize everything, both the processing of the systems and the evaluation of the cell-DF. Because he would have to do this many times, there will be errors. You must repeat this quickly.**  **Changes made:**  * Added a second "Yes" at the beginning of the sentence to reflect the repetition in the source text. * Removed the comma after "systems" for better fluency. * Changed "do it again quickly" to "repeat this quickly" for a more natural-sounding expression.  I believe this revised translation is accurate, fluent, and faithful to the original German text.

I was very disappointed when I received the item because the silver bezel seems to be made of a very cheap plastic. What disappoints me is not the fact that it is made of plastic, but that the plastic used makes the watch look incredibly cheap. This detail ruined the whole look for me. I also doubted its durability for everyday use, so I sent it back. I was disappointed because it seemed like a good deal if it hadn't been for that. If that's not a problem for you, it could be a good deal for you. It was well packaged and arrived quickly.  
I understand. Here is the English translation for the German sentence, along with the corrections based on the provided feedback:  **Source:** Ich habe die Nase voll von konservativen Parteien und Regierungen, die sich selbst als wirtschaftsfreundlich präsentieren. Das sind sie nicht, zumindest nicht in Alberta.  **English Translation:** I am fed up with conservative parties and governments that present themselves as business-friendly. They are not, at least not in Alberta.  **Corrections:**  * The unnecessary "Your" at the beginning of the sentence has been removed.  **Explanation:**  The original translation was accurate and fluent, but the unnecessary "Your" at the beginning of the sentence was a minor stylistic error. This has been corrected in the revised translation.  **Overall Quality:**  The revised translation is accurate, fluent, and free of errors. It faithfully conveys the meaning of the source text in a natural and idiomatic way.  **Error Classification:**  * Minor: 1 (unnecessary "Your" at the beginning of the sentence)  **Overall Score:**  5 out of 5

I bought this lamp to increase the light that my new vegetable seedlings get from the window. I love many of the features of these lamps. Advantages: First of all, they are easy to attach to my shelf and bend into many positions, so I can make changes as my plants grow. The lights feel cool and haven't caused any damage when they've touched the plants. I believe the light has helped my vegetables. The lights are dimmable, but I only use the brightest setting. I haven't used the timer yet, I prefer to turn them on and off myself. But this could be useful in an office with houseplants or when you're on vacation. Disadvantages: I don't think these lights are strong enough to be the main light source for growing plants. The lights are small! If the bulbs burn out, I have to buy a whole new lamp.

## Rectified English Translation:  Plans to grow lettuce in Penn in a 6-row pattern and see how that compares to broadcasting on seedbeds.   ## Error Analysis and Rectification:  The original target sentence contained a critical error: "Your case:". This phrase was not present in the source sentence and disrupted the flow and meaning of the translation.   By removing this extraneous phrase, the rectified translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence and is easy to understand for a native English speaker.  
I've tried and dropped absolutely every single one. And I had no idea until about two years ago, when I checked my transcripts.
(PERSON1) Yes, I think he told us at the beginning of the semester that if we want a one (one), then we get a one. Just submit it within the second deadline. That's pretty much the only thing he asked for. But he also told us that judging by the trend of the past few years, many people don't do it. They find it easier to read for the exam. No, sorry, to study for the exam.

Kazakh Prime Minister Smaiylov expressed special gratitude to Asian Athletics Association President Dahlan Al Hamad for his assistance in preparing and conducting the championships. The Asian Indoor Athletics Championships were held for the first time in the CIS. The tournament brought together over 500 athletes from 31 countries, who competed in running, relay, long jump, high jump, triple jump, pole vault, shot put and decathlon. The tournament runs until February 12. Earlier it was reported that at the tournament Kazakh runner Caroline Chepkoech Kipkurui won gold in the women's 3,000m race and Olga Safronova won silver in the women's 60m race.

Remote work makes many things possible. It allows people to work in comfortable spaces and not in stuffy, noisy offices.

I was fortunate enough to spend six unforgettable months working alongside Nicholas in 2011, supporting a range of projects. When we met at the weekend, I was delighted to hear about the progress, particularly in tree planting and agricultural support. Thousands of trees have been planted, and farmers have been able to increase their yields through a range of measures, from support in purchasing equipment to training.
This is a very beautiful skirt. The lace pattern is stylish and soft. It doesn't wrinkle, even after being stuffed in plastic and a cardboard box, it was still very smooth, which is really cool. The skirt can be easily worn with chic or casual clothes and has a certain vintage feel due to the length and cut, which I really like. I think it will suit everyone. I am 5'5" and weigh 130 pounds and ordered it in S, and I would say that if you can't decide between S and M, you should definitely go for the smaller size.

## Final English Translation:  Figures from the Norwegian Statistics Bureau showed that foreigners are spread across all districts of the city. In Søndre Nordstrand, Oslo's southernmost district, over 14,000 immigrants were registered. Many immigrants also lived in affluent neighborhoods, with Frogner ranking fifth among the districts with the most foreigners. Stovner, Bjerke, Grorud, Østensjø, and Sagene were the other five of Oslo's ten districts with the most residents from another country. These five districts, along with Frogner, made up the top six districts with the most foreign residents.

I understand. Here is the English translation for the German sentence "Bauchgefühl sagt, dass vermisste Frau nicht im Fluss ist":  **My gut feeling is that the missing woman is not in the river.**  I have made the following changes to the original translation:  * I have removed the phrase "Your case: Source:" as it is not a natural way to start a sentence in English. * I have replaced the phrase "Gut feeling" with "My gut feeling" to make the sentence more natural. * I have added the word "is" after "woman" to make the sentence grammatically correct. * I have made the sentence smoother by adding the word "that" after "feeling".  I believe that this translation is now accurate, fluent, and natural.

The owner of the Russian private military company Wagner Group, which is actively involved in the fighting in Ukraine, predicts that the war could go on for years. Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video interview released on Friday evening that it could take Russia 18 months to two years to gain full control of the Donbas, Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland. He added that the war could drag on for three years if Moscow decides to take more territory east of the Dnieper River.

## Rectified English Translation:  **Pictures: Following restorations, Egypt inaugurates the Djehuti and Hery tombs.**  **Explanation of Changes:**  * **"Fotos" to "Pictures":** While both "photos" and "pictures" are technically correct translations of "Fotos," "pictures" is a more natural and idiomatic choice in this context. * **Sentence Structure:** The sentence structure has been adjusted to more closely match the source text, improving the overall fluency and readability.  **Additional Notes:**  * The rectified translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source text while maintaining a natural and idiomatic style. * The changes made are minor and do not significantly alter the overall meaning of the sentence.  
GAZIANTEP.KAZINFORM – Kazakh rescuers continue to dig through the rubble in Turkey in search of survivors, according to the press service of the Kazakh Ministry of Emergency Situations. The rescuers' work is hampered by huge amounts of debris and unstable buildings. So far, the Kazakh rescue team has recovered seven earthquake survivors and the corpses of 19 people, including a child, in Turkey. First aid is also being provided around the clock. A major earthquake of magnitude 7.7, which devastated southern Turkey and northern Syria, occurred on Monday morning. To date, the death toll from the powerful earthquake that struck southern Turkey has already exceeded 20,000.  
"In our daily lives, we are constantly looking for ways to increase our energy and avoid burnout, especially in our jobs. This can be extremely difficult for people in the healthcare sector, which is why I asked 30 health and wellness professionals the same question: 'How do you manage your energy and avoid burnout in your profession?' Their professions ranged from infectious disease specialists to psychologists and mindfulness teachers, and they all offered great advice on how to stay motivated and on track. Despite the wide range of their activities, there were some common themes in their answers that stood out as methods to avoid burnout."  
## Final English Translation:  Russia suffered a series of devastating setbacks in the fall, as the Ukrainian military launched successful counteroffensives to retake large swaths of territory in the east and south. The Kremlin has avoided making predictions about how long the fighting could continue. Instead, it says the so-called "invasion" will continue until its goals are achieved. Russian forces have focused on the Ukrainian provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk, which make up the Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014.  
I bleached all my hair a few months ago and then dyed it black. Then I had highlights done all over. A few weeks after that, I added blue and green Arctic Fox hair dye to my hair, which just won't fade. I used Olaplex No. 3 with this, and it made everything significantly lighter, so the green and blue parts disappeared and the black color also became lighter. But a day later, I noticed a green tint in my hair. It's getting worse every day, and I've already used the hair dye remover twice - with the same results. My hair is also getting darker where I applied the hair dye. It's a great product, it just doesn't seem to last long.

The translation "Great backpack, but overdone on the straps" is accurate and fluent, but it does not capture the full meaning of the source sentence. The word "übertrieben" can also mean "exaggerated" or "over-the-top," so a more accurate translation would be:  **Great backpack, but the straps are a bit much.**  This translation is more idiomatic and conveys the same meaning as the source sentence. It is also more likely to be understood by a native English speaker.

And then I agree that there is a lot of unimportant stuff in this dictionary. So I asked if you could have different versions of this dictionary by only taking the words that were considered, five times. And only the pronunciations that were found three times or more, or something like that. So, in this way, these random errors, like the example with these four IBMs instead of IBM. That won't happen as often. But you will still have the variations in pronunciation, because if the person says this "alzo", if you remember, if he says this "alzo" with a "Z" 20 times in the conversation, then you will see that in the data with the "Z". And if she sometimes manages to say it correctly, then yes, you will also see that in the data. So, I would like [PERSON4] to be in contact with [PERSON2]. Maybe you can continue talking on the phone, right? I have to go now because I have to give the children lunch and so on. But please stay on this call and figure out together how to use the dictionary. So [PERSON4], please show [PERSON2] which dictionary the system accepts. Share your screen and show it. And [PERSON2], please, take a look at it and help with the conversion of the dictionary that you emitted into this file. One thing that is still needed is the replacement of the language model. But all these words should be familiar words. So [PERSON4], you need to find out which words are in the language model. And the words that are in the language model should simply be copied. So, the dictionary will have three columns. The grapheme, as it is output. One recognized. The phonemes, as suggested by [PERSON2]. And there will be several rows with different variants of phonemes. And the third column will also be the same for all of them again, and it will be the same grapheme form again. So that's what the language model sees. And I think that in this way, these systems should be able to load it. And you will probably encounter another problem: that it is not yet designed for two large custom dictionaries. So, that is also something that needs to be tested, but please test it, both of you together. So [PERSON2] knows what he has created in the dictionary. And you know what the dictionary looks like when you create it manually, and you need to put these two pieces of knowledge together. Ah, so that it works with the, with the generated dictionary.

Derry City emerged victorious from the President's Cup after defeating Shamrock Rovers 2-0. The FAI Cup holders overcame last season's winners at Brandywell thanks to first-half goals from Will Patching and Michael Duffy. The Hoops pressed in the second half, but Ruaidhri Higgins' charges were strong enough to secure the opener. Derry travel to St Patrick's Athletic for their first league game next Friday. Patching's side volley fired Derry ahead after 23 minutes - the midfielder scoring the first goal since the Foylesiders drew 2-1 with the eventual champions last February.  
There was particular dissatisfaction that Leigh Drennan, the chair of Labour North West and an advisor to Warrington North MP Charlotte Nichols, who supports Jeremy Corbyn, was not included on the longlist to try to win back seats from the Conservatives, despite being nominated by four major unions.

I prefer Bluetooth over Wi-Fi connection! I bought this product in October 2017 for my wife. At that time, we were in the middle of moving and living in a hotel. I couldn't connect the scale to the hotel's Wi-Fi. So I decided to wait until we moved into our own house and I could set up my own Wi-Fi. March 2018, I set up my Wi-Fi and the scale still won't connect. Every time I try, I get an error message. Even when I'm only 10 feet away from the Wi-Fi unit. I've also tried following the setup videos on YouTube, but without success. When I bought the device, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wi-Fi router to communicate with the phone. The system is limited to the router connection... which is usually not near the bedroom, unlike a phone! Because of the Wi-Fi connection, I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone. Look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication instead. I will also replace it with a scale with a Bluetooth connection.  
And then we will figure out which packages we need to install in the Petri environment.  
## English Translation:  Mostafa Waziri explained that these tombs belong to important people who lived during the beginning of the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom – one of the most important eras of Ancient Egypt. He said that the layout of the tombs is T-shaped, a style commonly used in tombs of the 18th Dynasty. These tombs consist of an entrance hall, a pillared hall leading to a burial chamber, and walls displaying unique inscriptions. Waziri added that Djehuti was the overseer of the treasury and supervised the work of craftsmen and artists during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut.  
The provided English translation is accurate and conveys the meaning of the German sentence well. However, there is one minor error in the second sentence:  * **Original:** Then life destroyed my soul and I lost all my passion for literature and great stories. * **Improved:** Then life crushed my spirit and I lost all my passion for literature and great stories.  The phrase "destroyed my soul" is a bit dramatic and unnatural in English. Replacing it with "crushed my spirit" maintains the meaning while sounding more natural.  Here is the final English translation:  **In my youth, I was an insatiable reader. Then life crushed my spirit and I lost all my passion for literature and great stories.**

The circumstances surrounding O'Hara were "quite extraordinary," Reeves said, but she conceded: "The Labour Party and all political parties have important things to learn about candidate selection. But I would also say that we have seen in this Parliament the constant undermining of political standards, not least by a succession of Prime Ministers and fines and parties and standards that fall far short of expectations." She added: "One thing I can say about the Labour Party is that if someone does something wrong, they can no longer be leader of the party. And that is simply not the case with the Conservative Party."  
So that's an important thing that we should have come across months ago. Remember, I've been telling you since August that we want to evaluate with a later test set. And every time, all of you... It's not just about you personally, [PERSON8]. There were other things, obviously. But every time you thought about it, you thought, "This will be easy, we'll just run it." And it's not until you actually do it that you see all the problems. So, that's known, quite normal. It's always like that. So that's a message for everyone. Before you try it, you never know what the problem will be. So, for example, the call I had when someone interviewed me, so they wanted to record the video. Zoom has never worked as badly for me as it did today during the recording. So, before you do it, you can't tell if it will work or not. And here we encounter problems with converting the file formats. So hopefully we'll get the numbers soon. So, do you have any word error rates so far?  
I learned the hard way that local TV station websites offer the absolute worst internet experience in 2023. Pop-ups, auto-playing videos, animations, pop-overs, and ads, ads, ads. I know they make their money from ads, but all this clutter seems counterproductive when it drives people away. This is even true now that goatse.cx is gone, although it would be a close race to the worst between goatse and, say, khou.com, where I tried to watch a video Wendy sent me.

## Final English Translation:  Jami handed him the note as they passed each other on the way, shortly before the dog watch. She was on her way to the wall, he had just finished work. He looked behind him to see her go and make sure they were not seen. She did not turn around. He waited until he was in the darkness of the bunk before pulling out the note and reading it in a ray of light that shone through the blackout curtains. One word printed in block letters. He stared at it for a long time, trying to stay calm. 
## English Translation:  One of the fans wasn't working properly right out of the box. The speed control is really weird: when you set it to 100%, the fans turn off, so you have to set it to 100% and then back it down a bit until they turn on again. The build quality is mediocre, but that seems to be normal for products in this price range. The stands that hold the laptop have come off a few times already. They can be plugged back in, but it happens so often that it's annoying. On the positive side, I can say that the fan position is ideal for laptops that draw in air through vents on the top of the laptop. Many other coolers have fans in the middle and offer little extra airflow for laptops with such cooling.  
## English Translation:  (Speaker 2) Yes, if the context is too short, and because I make decisions based on a very short context for this very low latency, then it really commits to something that, for example, finds out in a second or two, oh, well, that was really a bad translation. So it tries to use a different wording, for example, to specify the matter. So, actually, I really liked it. I like some of the translations. I was really surprised, although you could see that the model made mistakes on the first try, it really wanted to do some kind of correction. And it really sounded very fluent, which I think is also important. If you really demand low latency, then I think even slightly lower quality is okay if it's fluent. Because if you have bad translation quality and the translation is not fluent, then I think the translation is simply pointless. But if the quality is lower because the translation, when you read everything, that you get the same information, but the wording is simply bad, because it uses more words and corrections and things like that. So, I think that this is perfectly fine for simultaneous translation, as long as you don't lose information. And for which language pairs do you have these results, some examples? I would like to take a look at that, just out of curiosity.

## Final English Translation:  It's crazy to do weightlifting while having no real idea what your one-rep max is, since that's one of the main ways people track their progress. I train alone in my bedroom, with no spotter or even a weight rack. Just me and a barbell with a bunch of weights. I bench press on my bed. If I try to test my one-rep max, I probably won't have enough weights to reach my max, or else I could seriously injure/kill myself. Whatever, I'll just add some more weights today. Still feels good.

The incident occurred after a rise in the number of refugees and asylum seekers crossing the English Channel in boats. Police have arrested 15 people after anti-refugee protests turned violent outside a hotel near the English city of Liverpool, which is being used to house asylum seekers. According to Merseyside Police, one police officer and two civilians suffered minor injuries during the disturbance on Friday evening in Knowsley. Police said some protesters threw objects and set fire to a police van. The arrested people, aged between 13 and 54, were detained "on suspicion of violent disorder". Merseyside Police Commissioner Emily Spurrell told Radio City, "It was incredibly dangerous and there were some injuries to police officers."
