This has been rectified by removing the article, as the context makes it clear that the tensions being referred to are the specific tensions between the West and Russia over Ukraine.   ## Native Speaker Evaluation:  As a native English speaker, I find the rectified target segment to be both accurate and natural-sounding.

This error has been corrected in the rectified translation.  ## Quality Assessment:  The rectified translation is of excellent quality.

Here is the improved Russian translation:  **Пожалуйста, обратите внимание, что в некоторых странах местные почтовые службы не доставляют почтовые тубусы вместе с письмами и небольшими пакетами.**  This translation is more accurate, fluent, and natural-sounding than the previous one.
